Part of making open source software more welcoming to new
folks is making more and more of new folks' choices for
them.  Those of us in positions to make choices for others
should be very, very careful which choices we take away, how
we resolve them, and what we leave behind, to be reevaluated
later. Fundamentally, we're social engineering at a pretty
grand scale, well intentioned or not, invited or not. Wisdom
starts to look like hard trade-offs and self-doubt a lot
more often here.  Certainty becomes a warning sign.  Some
things won't be so easy to fix down the line.

When I look at the defaults we're setting for open source
these days, collectively, I see great cause for concern.  I
can't name a single company, project, foundation, or
personal contribution to the overall picture that stands out
as either unforgivably ill-intentioned or totally
wrong-headed. But in the aggregate, I see us entrenching and
exacerbating known problems.  Problems we're less confident
we can solve.

Don't get me wrong.  As a beginner, if instead of making a
choice I don't really understand, I get a sane default made
or compellingly suggested for me, I'm that much more likely
to find my feet and start walking.  Making hard choices
easier makes open source more accessible.  Hiding
error-prone complexity from those liable to trip and fall is
progress. `npm init --yes` gets you The ISC License.  The
ISC License isn't wrong.

But I've noticed that when it comes to community and
collaboration matters---choice of revision control tool,
code host, distribution network, contribution policies,
licenses, and so on---we tend to reach more readily, not
less, for superlatives like "best practices", "the right
way", "the norm", and the like.  We imply not only
confidence in the wisdom of our choices, borne of our
limited experience in some relatively small corner of the
overall open source picture, but confidence in their
exclusive and universal _correctness_.  Often, that's only
as true as our corner is wide.  In reality, what we're doing
is convention over configuration, version 2.0.  Convention
for how code gets made, rather than what code does, or how.

Careful, experienced hands choosing conventions can
massively empower greener folk following after them.  To
give a personal example, I'd be pretty embarrassed to admit
just how much about SQL data stores I "learned" from DHH's
Ruby on Rails screencasts.  Things those screencasts seemed
to assume I already knew.  Things `rails create` assumed I
wanted.

I didn't know much of anything about SQL data stores back
then.  If I knew what I wanted, it probably wasn't very
good.  Oddly enough, now that I do know a thing or two, I
find myself using SQL data stores less and less.  I went
from using SQL for everything under the sun, because it was
what I knew, or what I felt good about knowing, and part of
package that impressed me, to a more nuanced view.  SQL data
stores weren't the "right answer", at least outside of the
Rails mentality.  For a time, however, I think SQL data
stores, one of a bevy of Rails conventions, were better than
whatever answer I'd have otherwise given.

That's a good open source story, isn't it?  I grew up in the
middle of nowhere in Texas.  I ended up in the San Francisco
Bay Area, neck deep the open source community, putting one
foot in front of the other.  Having choices made for me.
Making my own choices.  Revisiting decisions I didn't know
had been made for me.  Full circle.

Why can't governance, licensing, collaboration, community
expectations, and the rest be part of that kind of story?
Perhaps we should be less confident that the "best
practices" we advocate today are truly and always best.  But
why impose that doubt on newcomers now, before they've had
their own changes to come full circle?

Because governance decisions, culture decisions, community
decisions, and legal decisions are different.
