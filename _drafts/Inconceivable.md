I published thoughts on the [nascent Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/version/2/0/license.html) [last week](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2020/02/22/Hippocratic-2.0). A few of other bloggers, [including Bruce Perens](https://perens.com/2019/09/23/sorry-ms-ehmke-the-hippocratic-license-cant-work/), have also published reads.    Many of us share concerns about the drafting of the license and how its terms interact.  But some, like Bruce, go further.  To read them tell it, it's not just that the drafting is flawed.  [Even if the terms were fixed, broader legal reasons would make the license unenforceable, unworkable, or simply kaput.](https://perens.com/2019/10/12/invasion-of-the-ethical-licenses/)

It's perfectly natural for opponents of a new license to diagnose flaws and pronounce them fatal.  If that troubled me, I'd be troubled all the time.  But bad legal information does trouble me.  Motivated reasoning presented as law---"I don't damn your license.  The law does."---troubles me.  Bad legal information troubles me.

Bruce is not a lawyer, but the last thing I want to do is discourage him or anyone else from reading and writing about the law.  I blog in large part to make more good legal information available to computer people, and to encourage them to put their hands on the levers of their legal power, such as their license terms.  At least in that sense, Bruce doesn't need a blog like mine.

But with great empowerment must follow a careful humility.  I can't stress enough a perhaps apocryphal quote that I've come to ascribe to Eben Moglen:  "Don't learn copyright law from free software people."  I would add:  Don't learn copyright by osmosis from free software practice.

The ethos of open licensing is a negation and rejection of the policy assumptions, and the ideological framework, behind copyright law.  Reading copyright law from a contrary perspective sets you up for research missteps and interpretive errors.  Likewise recycling legal memes from like-minded activists, such as [FSF's less-than-compelling points against HESSLA, an earlier "ethical license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/hessla.html).  That only reinforces a folk view of law at odds different with courts' and legislators'.  Which in turn yields bad advice and unwelcome surprises.

## Copyright works on the fed.

There are indeed special limits on suing governments like the United States federal government for copyright infringement, but that doesn't mean copyright licenses can't influence government behavior.

Bruce is right to point out that in general, you can't sue the government for whatever you want, as you could sue Google or your next door neighbor.  We say that governments have _sovereign immunity_, meaning they generally can't be sued for breaking their own laws.  Many folks are more familiar with _diplomatic immunity_, a similar privilege of diplomats and other government representatives abroad.  Same genre.

However, the government we're talking about is the same government that gives creators copyrights to motivate, compensate, and protect them.  That government actually _waives_, or gives up, its sovereign immunity for copyright infringement.  The relevant statute for the United States federal government is codified in title 28, section 1498(b) of the United States Code.

Bruce is right to note that the waiver comes with limits.  You can get money damages---orders that the government has to pay you for infringing your copyright---from the government for copyright infringement, but not other _legal remedies_ like injunctions---court orders that the government must follow.  Money damages can include awards of _statutory damages_ under section 504(c) of the Copyright Act, which sets minimum dollar amounts per infringement.  That's law that led to all those big, scary headlines about file shares owing millions to the RIAA.  But even if you don't qualify for statutory damages, the fact that your license didn't mention a royalty rate doesn't mean no damages for you at all.  Copyright holders routinely sue for infringement of works that they don't license on any terms at all, and still get damages.

So the government can just pay up, and keep using your code for evil?  Not so fast.

First and foremost, the special rules discussed above apply to lawsuits against the government and those "acting for the government and with the authorization or consent of the Government".  But depending on the circumstances, you're not limited to suing the government as such.  You might sue companies working contracts for government, and if there's anything we've learned since the Iraq War and Snowden, there are plenty of those.  You might also sue individuals involved in their private capacities.

More likely, you won't have to.  Government tech contracts don't tell contractors to ignore copyright, in reliance on sovereign immunity.  They contain much the same restrictions on outside and unlicensed intellectual property that private-sector contracts do, or more stringent restrictions, for many of the same reasons.  The same company policies around open license compliance and compatibility often apply.

Here as elsewhere, it's useful to look at other kinds of public licenses, like noncommercial, personal-use, and variously restricted terms.  In general, we don't see the United States government routinely trouncing those terms as if they didn't exist.  The same structures that encourage compliance with open licenses, like copyleft licenses, shore up other kinds of licenses.  It's not just about lawsuits.  That's just the credible threat motivating the preventive measures we deal with day by day.

> Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a court would actually enforce Ms. Ehmke's terms in a way that would change the activities of a violator.

> The terms are simply far more than could be enforced in a copyright license.

> There is no required performance in copyright that could be used for their enforcement, many of the entities that perform the objectionable acts are sovereign or otherwise not subject to copyright law, there is insufficient consent to her license.
