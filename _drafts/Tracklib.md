I've [reviewed the license terms for the Kingsway music sample marketplace](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/11/13/Kingsway.html) here on this blog.  Researching Frank Dukes, Kingsway's creator, led also to [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS5qmONlBcY0б) with [Tracklib](https://tracklib.com), another online platform for selling recordings to sample.

Tracklib's business model and licensing approach differ a bit from Kingsway's.  For one, Tracklib access starts with a subscription.

<table>
  <tr><td></td><th>Essential</th><th>Standard</th><th>Professional</th></tr>
  <tr><th>Cost Per Month</th><td>$6</td><td>$14</td><td>$30</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Downloads Per Month</th><td>5</td><td>15</td><td>35</td></tr>
</table>

Subscribers at any tier can top up their accounts with additional download credits.  Some tracks are also available for free---they do not cost a credit to download.

Users can stream any of the tracks for free.  Only downloading and licensing cost money.  There is also a less-emphasized "free tier" that only allows streaming and license management, with no credits to download.

<table>
  <tr><th>Category</th><th>License Cost</th><th>&le;2 Seconds Used</th><th>&le;15 Seconds</th><th>&le;60 Seconds</th></tr>
  <tr><th>A</th><td>$1,500</td><td>10%</td><td>25%</td><td>35%</td></tr>
  <tr><th>B</th><td>$500</td><td>5%</td><td>15%</td><td>25%</td></tr>
  <tr><th>C</th><td>$50</td><td>2%</td><td>10%</td><td>20%</td></tr>
</table>

Seconds used are seconds of the sampled recording.  Those snippets can be used any number of times or length of time in the new recording.  Percentages are percentages of revenue from the new recording, sometimes called "points".  Users must register their new recordings with the platform to purchase a license, which is specific to that new recording.

Throughout the site, Tracklib refers to this approach as "royalty-fair".
