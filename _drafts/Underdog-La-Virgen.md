If you haven't noticed---and they are trying really hard to make you notice---the Russian government's approach to the non-violent aspects of conflict basically revolves around projecting staunch readiness to perpetrate brazen cruelties, beyond whatever the high-water mark of brutality currently happens to be.  They are willing to do heinous things, get themselves caught, and lie about it with a straight face.  They are willing to seem petty, gross, callous, and disproportionate.  That is in fact the point.

It's considered essential for credibly asserting resolve and willingness to do whatever winning takes.  And it is rationalized humane, as exerting downward incentive pressure against prolonging the conflict or escalating it.  The headlines, photos, and videos it produces are visceral, appalling, and viral.   That is seen as amplifying the effect.

The high-water mark of brutality for the Russian domestic and Ukrainian populations aren't comparable.  One is true war, and a bleak and degenerate form of it.  The other is an ugly, brutish, cartoon totalitarianism.  But both flow from the same general strategy.  Both are maintained and "managed" the same way.  This is how the clique that rules Russian understand human behavior.

A thin, bright sheen over the oil slick of black news this creates is the continued, incredible existence of Редакция, Russian for "editorial staff", as in "send it up to editorial", an [independent YouTube news studio](https://www.youtube.com/@redactsiya) still operating in-country.  The group began as one-man show of [Alexey Pivovarov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexey_Pivovarov), formerly anchor at an independent news channel later subordinated to the state.  Striking out on his own online, he's gathered a team turning out coverage that, despite a laser beam grid of censorship, frankly tops anything of the kind I know in English.  Think [60 Minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes) on Sunday plus mini [Frontline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontline_(American_TV_program)) docs in between, but younger, shorter, and free online.

It's dry.  It's straight.  It's highly professional, seasoned with the occasional straight-man smirk and, at least before the war, tongue-in-cheek VFX and other gags visited upon the anchor by the editor.  At this point, I have serious concerns that anchors Alexey, Sasha, Dmitry, Ilya, and Elena could report the bear-mauling deaths of their own grandmas without breaking tone, cadence, or standards.  God forbid.

The state has branded Alexey a "foreign agent", imposing wordy boilerplate disclaimers at the start of every video and social media post.  No rationale for this assessment was forthcoming, and none was ever really expected.  But they can't shut YouTube down, because without [Peppa Pig](https://www.youtube.com/@PeppaPigOfficial) modern parenting will collapse, and Russian society will rise in revolt.  So goes one of the many dour Russian jokes on the matter.

Pivovarov's group is naturally somewhat limited covering the war.  They've got away with reporting dry facts, by citing foreign media and Russian Telegram channels, but have to dance around many blurry lines.  Atop the steady drumbeat of ever more numbing front-line war updates, they've covered the bitter dirge of domestic happenings, too.

I assume English readers interested in the former have got their fill.  As a taste of the latter, beyond the top-line headlines on Navalny and other famous figures, consider this segment [from their weekly Sunday show of March 19](https://youtu.be/T5baZvOXmrc?t=883):

> On Friday evening, to the Moscow bars Underdog and La Virgen, widely known among the more advanced city youth, came the police.  By the testimony of eye-witnesses, with sledgehammers and tasers.

> <p>В пятницу вечером в московские бары Underdog и La Virgen, широко известны среди продвинутой городской молодежи, пришла полиция.  По свидетельству очевидцев с кувалдами и электрошокерами.</p>
> </details>

It's hard to translate the slightly underhanded tone of "advanced" here.  [The bars are hipster bars.](http://underdog-moscow.ru/)  It's not unheard of for businesses to use foreign-language names, especially in the big cities.  But English especially feels a bit more tenuous now.

If the sledgehammers remind you of Wagner Group, you're not wrong, but it goes both ways.  Russian police raiders, who equip and act a lot like more militarized American SWAT, will absolutely carry them as breaching equipment.  And then employ them liberally.  Or, rather, illiberally.

> According to sources of TASS, the visits were connected to suspicions of participation by the bars in financing of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.  Last summer in one of them there was supposedly a collection of money for a charitable fund that announced support for the Ukrainian Army.  The owners of the bar later explained that their account was hacked and that the money was collected exclusively to help homeless animals.

> <p>По словам источника ТАСС, визиты были связаны с подозрением в причастности баров к финансированию ВСУ.  Еще прошлым летом в одном из них якобы собирали деньги для благотворительной фонды, которая объявляла поддержку украинской армии.  Владельцы бара потом объясняли, что их аккаунт был взломан, а деньги собирались исключительно на помощь бездомным животным.</p>

TASS is the big Russian news wire service, descending down from Soviet times.  Think [Associated Press](https://apnews.com), if the press were subsumed by government.  [Here's the story.](https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17305585)

> This time several guests had tattoos inspected.  One of the girls was forced to write on the doors "Z" and "For Russia".  A few other customers were made to sing along to songs by Shaman and Lyube.

> <p>В этот раз у некоторых посетителей проверяли татуировки.  Одну из девочек велели написать на дверях "Z" и "За Россию".  Еще нескольких клиентов заставили подпевать песни Шамана и группы Любэ.</p>

Tattoo inspections are a thing for Russian security services.  They're mentioned in nearly every firsthand account of the "filtration camps" where Ukrainian refugees and prisoners of war get vetted.

It's a sign of commitment to wear nationalist tattoos in the region.  If things go down, you know you'll be marked, and therefore at risk if captured.  Your humble author was once threatened bodily by a squat, bald, steroid-bloated drawler with РОССИЯ (RUSSIA) in bold blackletter across his pecs.  On a train.  On Victory Day.  Heading to Moscow.  About a blanket.

The "for" in "For Russia" is written and spoken "za".  They've been writing it with the Latin letter Z since that took off as public symbol of the war.

Shaman is a Russian pop star of recent manufacture, who's turned out a number of solipsistic, nationalism-infused, otherwise forgettable pop tracks, before and now during the war.  He gets lots of airtime on state TV and performs at Putin's big rallies.

Lyube is a classic-rock group from a storied, rough-and-tumble district on the outskirts of Moscow.

Imagine going to a bar for brewpub tacos on a Friday and ending up singing [Lee Greenwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KoXt9pZLGM) or [Lynryd Skynyrd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZQ5T8wjsg) for a SWAT team.  On camera.  For the news.

> About fifty people were taken to the Basmanniy police station where they had the Telegram application on their phones searched, after which the majority were released.

> <p>Около 50 человек были доставлены в ОВД Басманный, где у них проверили приложение Телеграм в телефонах, после чего большинство отпустили.</p>

The Basmanniy station is infamous for delivering foregone convictions of opposition leaders and protesters.

Telegram checks have also become cliche.  After arrest.  During "filtration".  At border crossings.  We heard a lot about those last as waves of young Russians, especially tech-savvy ones, fled the country earlier on in the war.

They actually did ban Telegram once.  But it came back.  Something about it not being encrypted by default.  Something about it having a very "open" API.
