If you haven't noticed---and they are trying really hard to make you notice---the Russian government's approach to the non-war parts of conflict revolves around constantly projecting a brazen, constant readiness to act gross beyond the brink.  The words наглость and нахальность come to mind---impudence, insolence, effrontery.  They are willing to be petty, gross, and disproportionate, in order to stoke the impression that they will do whatever it takes to win.

A thin, bright sheen over the putrid oil slick of the news thus created is the continued, incredible existence of Редакция, Russian for "editorial staff", an [independent YouTube news studio](https://www.youtube.com/@redactsiya) still based in-country.  The group was started by Andrei Pivovarov, former anchor of an independent news channel later subordinated by forces loyal to the state.  Since striking out on his own online, he's gathered a team turning out news coverage that is, frankly, better than anything I know in English covering America.

It is very dry.  It is very straight.  It is very professional.  At this point, I have serious concerns that Andrei could report the bear-mauling death of his own grandma without breaking tone or cadence.  God forbid.

The state has branded Andrei a "foreign agent", imposing wordy boilerplate disclaimers at the start of every video and social media post.  No rationale for this assessment was forthcoming.  But they can't shut YouTube down, because without [Peppa Pig](https://www.youtube.com/@PeppaPigOfficial) modern parenting will collapse, and society will rise in revolt.  So goes one of the many bemused Russian jokes on the matter.

Pivovarov's group is somewhat limited in covering the war.  They've gotten away with reporting dry facts, but have to dance around a blurry line tied to a landmine.  But apart from the numbing drumbeat of front-line updates, the domestic news has been its own bitter dirge.  Some facts need no dramatic embellishment.  Some stories just don't need anyone to yell about them.

Consider this segment [from their weekly Sunday show of March 19](https://youtu.be/T5baZvOXmrc?t=883):

> On Friday evening, to the Moscow bars Underdog and La Virgen, widely known among the more advanced city youth, came the police.  By the testimony of eye-witnesses, with sledgehammers and tasers.

> <p>В пятницу вечером в московские бары Underdog и La Virgen, широко известны среди продвинутой городской молодежи, пришла полиция.  По свидетельству очевидцев с кувалдами и электрошокерами.</p>

It's hard to translate the slightly underhanded tone of "advanced" here.  [The bars are hipster bars.](http://underdog-moscow.ru/)

If the sledgehammers remind you of Wagner Group, you're not wrong, but it goes both ways.  Russian police strike teams, which equip and act a lot like the more militarized American SWAT teams, will absolutely carry them as breaching equipment.  And then employ them liberally.  Or, rather, illiberally.

> According to sources of TASS, the visits were connected to suspicions of participation by the bars in financing of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.  Last summer in one of them there was supposedly a collection of money for a charitable fund that announced support for the Ukrainian Army.  The owners of the bar later explained that their account was hacked and that the money was collected exclusively to help homeless animals.

> <p>По словам источника ТАСС, визиты были связаны с подозрением в причастности баров к финансированию ВСУ.  Еще прошлым летом в одном из них якобы собирали деньги для благотворительной фонды, которая объявляла поддержку украинской армии.  Владельцы бара потом объясняли, что их аккаунт был взломан, а деньги собирались исключительно на помощь бездомным животным.</p>

TASS is the big Russian news wire service, descending down from Soviet times.  Think Associated Press, if the press were subsumed by government.  [Here's the story.](https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/17305585)

> This time several guests had tattoos inspected.  One of the girls was forced to write on the doors "Z" and "For Russia".  A few other customers were made to sing along to songs by Shaman and Lyube.

Tattoo inspections are a thing for Russian police and intelligence people.  They're mentioned in nearly every firsthand account of the "filtration camps" where Ukrainian refugees and prisoners of war get vetted.

It's a sign of commitment to wear nationalist tattoos in the region.  If things go down, all sides now they'll be marked, and therefore identifiable.  Your humble author was once threatened bodily by a squat, bald, steroid-bloated drawler with РОССИЯ (RUSSIA) in bold blackletter across his pecs.  On a train.  On Victory Day.  Heading to Moscow.  It was about a blanket.

The "for" in "For Russia" is written and spoken "za".  They've been writing it with the Latin letter Z since that took off as public symbol of the war.

Shaman is a Russian pop star of recent manufacture who's turned out a number of solipsistic, nationalism-infused, otherwise forgettable pop-vocal tracks, before and now during the war.  He gets lots of airtime on state TV and performs at all Putin's music rallies.

Lyube is a classic-rock group from a storied, rough-and-tumble district on the outskirts of Moscow.

Imagine going to a bar for brewpub tacos on a Friday and ending up singing [Lee Greenwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KoXt9pZLGM) or [Lynryd Skynyrd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ZQ5T8wjsg) for a SWAT team, then being arrested for it.  On camera.  For the news.

> About fifty people were taken to the Basmanniy police station where they had the Telegram application on their phones searched, after which the majority were released.

> <p>Около 50 человек были доставлены в ОВД Басманный, где у них проверили приложение Телеграм в телефонах, после чего большинство отпустили.</p>

The Basmanniy station is infamous for delivering command-performance convictions of opposition leaders and protesters.

Telegram checks have also become cliche.  After arrests.  During "filtration".  At border crossings.  We heard a lot about those last as waves of young Russians, especially tech-savvy ones, fled the country earlier on in the war.

They actually did ban Telegram once.  But it came back.  Something about it not being at all encrypted by default.  Something about it having a very principled, "open" API.
