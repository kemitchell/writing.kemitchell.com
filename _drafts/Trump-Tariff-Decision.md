The United States Court of Trade, a specialized federal court for trade lawsuits, recently [ruled](https://downloads.kemitchell.com/2025-05-28 VOS Selections v US.pdf) that Donald Trump didn't have the legal power to impose the tariffs he announced as responses to drug trafficking and trade imbalances.  Here were a couple of headlines covering it:

- [Axios: "Court says Trump doesn't have the authority to set tariffs"](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-tariffs-trade-court-ruling)

- [ABC: "Federal court says Trump doesn't have the power to impose tariffs unilaterally"](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/federal-court-trump-power-impose-tariffs-unilaterally/story?id=122290881)

Based on whatever you've gathered about the decision up to now, do you see any problem with these headlines?

Compare these others:

- [USA Today: "Trade court blocks President Donald Trump's tariffs"](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/28/trump-tariffs-blocked-trade-court/83909721007/)

- [CNN: "US court blocks Trump from imposing the bulk of his tariffs"](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/business/us-court-blocks-trumps-tariffs)

- Axios: "Trump's tariffs blocked by federal trade court", an alternate headline sometimes displayed for [the very same article linked above](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-tariffs-trade-court-ruling)

Or these:

- [AP: "Federal court blocks Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs under emergency powers law"](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-court-0392dbd59f548e49ad4f64254ae3f94a)

- [The Hill: "Court of International Trade blocks Trump's tariffs in sweeping ruling"](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5322889-court-rules-trump-tariffs/)

The first group of headlines _beg to mislead_.  They can be read two ways.  One is accurate.  The other is broader, more dramatic, more exciting, and wrong.  How broad was the court's decision?

The court did _not_ rule that the president can't impose tariffs on his own, or that the president always has to act with Congress to impose them.  It _did_ rule that the president doesn't have the power to impose _the particular_ tariffs disputed in the lawsuit.

I'd call the first group of headlines clickbait.  I'd also call them _lawyerly_ in the worst way.  They're playing tricky word games with distinctions that matter to influence conclusions.

Trump, as president, _does_ have some power to set tariffs.  The court's decision says he does.  There are some procedural requirements for tariffs the president can impose, but for some purposes, the president can impose tariffs without prior approval by Congress.  Those would be fair to call "unilateral", in the sense of the executive branch acting alone, without the courts or Congress.

The court's decision covers all of this.

## The Decision in Brief

The court breaks down the tariffs into two groups, "trafficking tariffs" announced in executive orders and declarations giving drug trafficking as primary motivation, and "worldwide and retaliatory tariffs" based on concerns about unfair trade, tariffs, and economic policies.

The basic law is that the Constitution gives Congress the power to regular foreign trade under article I, section 8, clauses 1 and 3:

<details>
<summary>Language from the Constitution</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>The Congress shall have Power To <mark>lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises</mark>, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;</p>
<p>â€¦</p>
<p><mark>To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations</mark>, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;</p>
</blockquote>
</details>

Congress can't give this power over from the legislature to the executive just by passing a normal law, without amending the constitution.  But it can pass laws to delegate part its power to the president in limited ways.

The administration pointed to the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act) as the law giving it delegated power to impose the tariffs.  The court goes through the history of that law.

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act works in tandem with another law, the National Emergencies Act, that sets up processes for executive to declare national emergencies.  That law also got changed over time in response to court cases, specifically around how Congress can vote to terminate national emergencies declared by the President.

The court struck down the "worldwide and retaliatory" tariffs because they're extremely broad and the court can't read the part of the International Emergency Powers Act delegating power to the Executive to impose unbounded tariffs.  It can't read the law that way because doing so would violate the rules about how Congress can delegate the powers the Constitution say belong specifically to the legislative branch of government.  The first of those rules, called the "nondelegation doctrine", requires Congress to specify an "intelligible principle" according to which the power has to be exercised, passing a law that "meaningfully constraints" the President's delegated power.

The court struck down the "trafficking" tariffs because the International Emergency Economic Powers Act requires that the President's actions address the declared national emergency.  It found no reasoning in the orders showing how the tariffs address drug trafficking, and rejected the idea that using tariffs to create diplomatic pressure or negotiating leverage alone counts, since that could justify nearly anything.

<blockquote>
<ol type=a>
  <li>Any authority granted to the President by section 203 <mark>may be exercised to deal with</mark> any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.</li>
  <li>The authorities granted to the President by section 203 <mark>may only be exercised to deal with</mark> an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared for purposes of this title <mark>and may not be exercised for any other purpose</mark>. Any exercise of such authorities to deal with any new threat shall be based on a new declaration of national emergency which must be with respect to such threat.

The most important older legal decisions the court relies on were in cases brought by a company called Yoshida International against broad tariffs imposed by the Nixon administration in the 1970s.  The first of those decisions led Congress to change the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, adding more limits on what the President could do.  The second actually upheld the tariffs under the revised law, but strongly emphasized that the law has limits, and the tariffs passed because they were limited.  Lawyers would say the court _distinguished_ this case, about Trump's tariffs, from the Yoshida case, about Nixon's.
