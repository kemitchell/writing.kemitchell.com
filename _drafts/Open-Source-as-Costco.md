Heather Meeker just shared [a recorded talk for the ZOOOM Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt4bbwoaXK0) on YouTube.  It's worth watching.  A few quick thoughts for after:

## Open Source Company as Costco

First, I think this is a really interesting work of parallel-drawing.  On the tactical level---marketing, hiring, reputation---I suspect comparisons can be really fruitful.  It's tempting to draw a broad distinction between go-hard-go-fast and steady-slow companies.  We see companies succeed on both ends of that spectrum in software, too.

However, I think the broader analogy to Costco wobbles a bit, fundamentally.  Costco charges membership fees.  While _revenue_ from sales make the big numbers on its financial statements, analysis I've read suggests most of its _profits_ come from membership fees.  As Heather pointed out, they have millions of members.  As I write, the cheapest membership runs $65 per year.

The only thing I'm aware non-members can get from Costco is free entry to buy alcohol in some states, due to quirks of state laws.  Otherwise, you have to buy a membership to reap any of the benefits of Costco's selection, procurement, and pricing.  That cost of entry is why Costco shoppers tend to be either richer than average or businesses buying to resell.

Companies developing open source software projects charge customers, too.  Their customers rolls may feel a bit like a club, especially as compared to the often larger group of "community" users.  But the open source work that makes those companies "open source companies" aren't [club goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_good).  They're [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)).

I'm not aware that Costco offers any products or services gratis to any part of the public outnumbering its paid membership, other than at a huge leap in abstraction up, doing some corporate charity and being a business that buys land, hires people, and pays sales taxes, with publicly traded stock.  To Heather's point, Costco actually seems to do little if any cross-subsidizing on principle, with the possible exception of loss-leader hot dogs and perhaps [rotisserie chickens](https://www.eatthis.com/costco-rotisserie-chicken/).  But even those eye-catching deals are limited to paying members.  They're benefits _of the club_---and inducements to go to and wander through the stores once you've joined.  Hot dogs are at the front, chickens at the back, past a lot of other merchandise.

At the risk of floating one bad analogy to sink another, imagine Costco announced that it would open a parallel chain of smaller corner stores.  The new stores would be branded "Costco" and follow all the same markup and stocking rules as the warehouses, but wouldn't require any membership for shopping.  Instead of selling items by the boxful, "Costco Corner" would sell small multipacks.  They wouldn't sell large items like furniture or electronics, but would carry more snacks and personal items.

Arguably, Costco Corner would not inhabit the same market segment as Costco warehouses.  Many of its potentially regular clientele---urban shoppers without cars, single people, low-income renters---would not overlap with Costco's membership.  The store chains could be termed complementary, rather than competitive.

But I suspect critiques of Costco as a charity benefiting shoppers---not just paying members, but any shoppers---would have more bite.  Internally, I'd also expect more the kinds of tensions and dramas we so often seen in open source companies: people working on the "business" side who'd rather work on the "open" side, fights about how much "closed" should spend on "open", debates about whether new products or services should be paid or free, and, of course, questions from current and potential stock owners about whether the "open" sideline is really serving the business.

Costco is a members-only shopping club selling physical goods manufactured by others.  If if it's fun to say open source companies are somehow like Costco, it's a lot harder to say Costco is much like open source companies.

## No IP

Heather shares an interesting cost-comparison table of SaaS sold by the seat:

| Open Core    | Price/User/Month | Proprietary | Price/User/Month |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Cal.com      | 15               | Calendly    | 8-10             |
| NocoDB       | Free             | Airtable    | 20               |
| Open Project | 7                | Jira        | 7                |
| Appflowy     | 10               | Notion      | 10               |
| Odoo         | 24.90            | Quickbooks  | 30               |

This on her way to a point about the value of intellectual property: "Where are all the royalties for IP?", she asks.  Seen that way, the only IP that really matters is branding.  IP as in trademarks.

But I can read this table another way:  These companies aren't failing to get money for their valuable IP.  They failed to get the IP that's valuable: the kind you can enforce to protect yourself from getting undercut by cloners.  Cloners who don't have to invest or recoup your research and development effort.

Advising companies, I also sing the song of reputation's importance.  Perhaps especially as a deals guy, it's important to remind myself how much opportunity gets created, and business gets done, thanks to confidence that _doesn't_ need the clarity or enforceability of written contracts.

At the same time, "reputation" is comfortably fuzzy, like its cousin "goodwill".  It can be tempting to avoid hard, awkward accounting by incrementing a catch-all that makes everything add up.  It can be tempting to forget how fragile business reputation can be, or the edge hard times can bring to the soft and cooperative luxuries of business that bloom in greener times.  There's real money to be made simply being the person or team who is _willing_ and _available_ to do the job, even if it's a job lots of others could step up and do.  But having a more established defense than that---building a "moat" of the IP kind or some other---goes a long way.

It's well within a businessperson's discretion, and not unavoidably wrong, to choose to forgo "strong IP" protection and other heavier-handed advantages.  But we should all be clear when that's what's going on.  There are plenty of software offerings out there _without_ more "open" competitors.  Some of those are charging a lot more per user,in part because nobody else offers a substitute for less.  At least not yet.
