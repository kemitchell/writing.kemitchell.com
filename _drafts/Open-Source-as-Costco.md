Heather Meeker just shared [a recorded talk for the ZOOOM Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt4bbwoaXK0) on YouTube.  It's worth watching.  A few quick thoughts for after:

## COSS as Costco

First, I think this is a really interesting work of parallel-drawing.  On the tactical level---marketing, hiring, reputation---I suspect comparisons can be really fruitful.  It's tempting to draw a broad distinction between go-hard-go-fast and steady-slow companies.  We see companies succeed on both ends of that spectrum in software, too.

However, I think the broader analogy to Costco wobbles a bit, fundamentally.  Costco charges membership fees.  While _revenue_ from sales make the big numbers on its financial statements, analysis I've read suggests most of _profits_ come from membership fees.  As Heather pointed out, they have millions of members.  As I write, the cheapest membership runs $65 per year.

The only thing I'm aware non-members can get from Costco is free entry to buy alcohol in some states, due to quirks of state laws.  Otherwise, you have to buy a membership to reap any of the benefits of Costco's selection, procurement, and pricing.  That cost of entry is why Costco shoppers tend to be either richer than average or businesses buying to resell.

Companies developing open source software projects charge customers, too.  Their customers rolls may feel a bit like a club, especially as compared to the often larger group of "community" users.  But the open source work that makes those companies "open source companies" aren't [club goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_good).  They're [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)).

I'm not aware that Costco offers any products or services gratis to any part of the public outnumbering its paid membership, other than a huge leap in abstraction up, doing some corporate charity and being a business that buys land, hires people, pays sales taxes, and issues public stock.  To Heather's point, Costco actually seems to do little if any cross-subsidizing on principle, with the possible exception of loss-leader hot dogs and perhaps [rotisserie chickens](https://www.eatthis.com/costco-rotisserie-chicken/).  But even those eye-catching deals are limited to paying members.  They're benefits _of the club_---and inducements to go to and wander through the stores.  Hot dogs are at the front, chickens at the back.

Floating one bad analogy to criticize another, imagine if Costco announced tomorrow that it would also start operating a nationwide chain of smaller corner stores.  The stores would be branded "Costco" and follow all the same selection and pricing rules as the warehouse stores, but would not require any membership for shopping.  Instead of selling items by the boxful, "Costco Corner" would sell all goods in small multipacks.  They wouldn't sell large items like furniture or electornics, but would carry more small snacks and personal items.

Arguably, Costco Corner would not inhabit the same market segment as Costco warehouses.  Many of its potentially regular clientele---urban shoppers without cars, single people, low-income renters---would not overlap with Costco members.  The store chains could be complementary, rather than competitive.

But I suspect critiques of Costco as a charity benefiting shoppers---not just paying members, but any shoppers---would have more bite.  Internally, I'd also expect more the kinds of tensions and dramas we so often seen in open source companies: people working on the "business" side who'd rather work on the "open" side, fights about how much "closed" should spend on "open", debates about whether new products or services should be paid or free.  And, of course, questions from current and potential owners of stock about whether the "open" sideline is really worthwhile as business.

## No IP

Heather shares an interesting cost-comparison table of SaaS sold by the seat:

| Open Core    | Price/User/Month | Proprietary | Price/User/Month |
|--------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Cal.com      | 15               | Calendly    | 8-10             |
| NocoDB       | Free             | Airtable    | 20               |
| Open Project | 7                | Jira        | 7                |
| Appflowy     | 10               | Notion      | 10               |
| Odoo         | 24.90            | Quickbooks  | 30               |

This is on the way to a point about the value of intellectual property.  "Where are all the royalties for IP", she asks.  Seen that way, the only IP that really matters is branding, which Heather helpfully maps to trademarks.

But I can read this table another way:  These companies aren't failing to get money for IP.  They simply failed to get the IP that matters: the kind you can enforce to protect yourself from being undercut by cloners.  Cloners who don't have to invest or recoup your research and development effort.

Advising companies, I also sing the song of reputation's importance.  Perhaps especially as a contracts guy, it's sometimes easy to underestimate how much opportunity gets created, and business gets done, thanks to confidence that _doesn't_ need the clarity of enforceability of a written backstop.  But at the same time, "reputation" is fuzzy like "goodwill".  It can be tempting to avoid hard, awkward work by incrementing a catch-all column that makes everything add up.  It can be tempting to forget how fragile business reputation can be, or the edge hard times can bring to the soft and cooperative luxuries of business that bloom in greener times.
