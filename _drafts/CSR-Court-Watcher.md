Those looking to stay on top of legal developments outside their own fields might appreciate the [Congressional Research Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service)'s "Congressional Court Watcher" reports.  I've been reading them regularly for a while now.

[Here's the most recent, from October 2, on EveryCRSReport.com.](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/LSB11053.html)  That site also publishes an [RSS feed of the latest reports](https://www.everycrsreport.com/rss.xml).  I use some scripts to filter that feed down, updating <https://rss.kemitchell.com/crs-court-watcher.xml> with just the Court Watcher reports.
