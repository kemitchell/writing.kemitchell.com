I finally had a chance to review the ["Minimum Viable Secure Product" controls](https://www.mvsp.dev/mvsp.en/) pushed [by Google](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/11/two-years-later-baseline-that-drives-up.html) as a would-be "standard" for "enterprise-ready" SaaS vendors.  Overall, I'm glad to see another useful checklists published free on the Web, but was struck by two particular items:

> Implement single sign-on using modern, maintained, and industry-standard protocols for all customers <mark>at no additional cost</mark>

> Logs must be stored for at least 30 days <mark>at no additional charge</mark>, and should not contain sensitive data or payloads.

As helpful, sensible, and in the end, totally predictable as the rest of the list may be, these blips immediately called this out as a buyer leverage play.  Apparently they were [added in a new version earlier this year](https://www.csoonline.com/article/1253036/google-expands-minimum-security-guidelines-for-third-party-vendors.html).
