Trying to bat down the White House's ["association"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/fact-evidence-suggests-link-between-acetaminophen-autism/) between acetaminophen and autism with ["correlation does not imply causation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation) is losing the rematch the way you lost the title.  If outsiders can spin your field so middle schoolers understand, but you and your colleagues only respond with more jargon, you are not even a fair match.  You're a punching bag making satisfying "puff" noises as more air gets beaten out of you.

Fine points on Latinate terms like "association" become weaknesses as soon as answering up requires more than solidarity among your own.  Heaping on [nominalizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalization) like "correlation" and "causation" won't reach the people who don't hear "association" like you do.  For any willful distortion especially, they are the audience.  It actually _hurts_ that the go-to zinger rhymes. It makes it so fun for insiders to say that it edges out any other, perhaps plainer expression.

I could offer "refutation does not entail comprehension" here, and perhaps that would stick.  It would still miss the point.  That's not common English, either.

Responding effectively means speaking to be understood by a lot more people, without any hint that you want to impress them.  A ready stock of relatable metaphors.  A cheat sheet of lived examples.  Parables for present day.

I'm sure the art of the telling has advanced since ["ice cream does not cause drownings"](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/more-ice-cream-sold-more-drownings-why/ar-AA1HihPI) back when I was in school.  Yet despite seeing no little coverage of this new autism line, I couldn't tell you the go-to case of a medical treatment wrongly ditched before the data actually condemned it.  That talking point is simply missing in action.

I write about this not to score inter-specialty rivalry points.  I've never seen the booth where we can trade those in for prizes.  I write because law's been on the ropes, too, tripping in a tangle of it own untied bootlaces.

Lawyer talk also has Magic Latin Disease.  Big time.  Plus [Bunk French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_French) and a penchant for hijacking [actual](https://thelawdictionary.org/notice-2/) [English](https://thelawdictionary.org/damages/).  I've no better hope for dusty constitutional clunkers like "habeas corpus", "attainder", and "ex post facto" in the line of modern rhetorical fire.

So little of "English Liberty" wound up in actual English in our constitution.  We could find that shocking if we didn't know full well how this happens to speech.  The obscure lingo and dusty decorum that make law students feel like [admitted wizards](https://www.tampabay.com/archive/2000/12/28/harry-potter-fans-wild-about-wizardspeak/), then shield them from muggle meddling in practice, have their price.  Scrambling for competence and acceptance, then achieving them by leveraging the new language, we get no practice making plain to others, or even to ourselves, what our cryptic incantations have to do with important stories and lessons of the past.  Without the voice to speak right back down to that grounding so others can understand us, our fancy warbling comes to seem rootless, the weird, constructed language of some long-inherited mass-consensual fairly land of lawyers.

The rhetorical pressure on the details blows out the other end of the language.  Ever more often, glittering generalities like "freedom" and "liberty" don't summon the magic like they used to, because they've served too long as mere call-outs to a vague collective will to keep things calmly carrying on.  As terms, they may have been defined, but they weren't renewed by usage in frank, informal conversations, just sprinkled like rhetorical glitter by showmen and people in suits.  If they don't stand for specific stories, they can mean nearly anything.  Once openly contested, they do.

We're seeing judges mash the panic button, [trying to write straight to the public](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2025/04/20/Fourth-Circuit-Abrego-Garcia).  But they're doing it pages deep into twelve-point, double-spaced, Times New Roman PDFs, hidden behind boilerplate for [we-can-decide-this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction) and [here's-how-we-do-our-job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_review), minced with cryptic [Bluebook citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebook), then buried on one of hundreds of bad .gov websites or locked behind a [publicly funded paywall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACER_%28law%29#Fees).  This grim gauntlet for human attention fairly ensures that only scant quotes picked by the gaunt carrion birds of the headline-driven media make it out to broadest circulation---ripped from context, reframed, and too often distorted by the grim, clicks-quota panic we now impose on journalists.

How jarring the difference in attention and readership in and out of their courtrooms must be.  How flabbergasting the clear cases of Justice saying one thing for the cameras and another in court.  How strange the rising wave of clearly invalid, press-release statutes, knowingly baseless, headline-making lawsuits, counter-statutes, counter-suits, and on and on, until "who started it?" no longer makes sense and "how does it end?" is anyone's guess.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court pauses court order after order against executive action, often without a word of explanation.  The "emergency" animating the suddenly lively [emergency docket](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/emergency/emergency-docket-2024/) seems more and more like great haste to end or cripple the [rule that lets the legislature limit who the president can fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey%27s_Executor_v._United_States), and perhaps also other rules, on the way to a more ["unitary executive"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory).  So much so that they want the game played by the new rules immediately, before they get around to saying explicitly what those rules actually are, or stand publicly accountable for any reasoning.

Some judges cry out, but whether from pure momentum or fear of appearing naked without their usual trappings, smother their own cries in forms and styles that make them largely inaccessible and mostly incomprehensible.  Higher judges set procedures aside and write little or nothing at all, leaving few indeed with knowledge enough to read between lines that aren't there.

There is opportunity here, not just threat.  The political moment now makes it suddenly expedient to do what has too long been put off.  Test our understanding of the bedrocks our fields through the challenge of expressing it afresh so the public really gets it.  Revisit the styles and habits grown insular, strange, and self-referential over the years, creating the isolation that's now so exploitable.

It's no great joy to know the costs as well as the benefits of the way we specialists get things done.  But there is dignity in knowing and facing them.
