Fellow deals lawyer:  How many differently worded choice-of-law clauses did you send to clients last year?

I have no idea, myself.  For a professional wordsmith, laboring under weighty expectations of drafting precision, that leaves me feeling a bit a fraud.  Granted, choice-of-law is pretty humdrum, as clauses go.  But especially so, shouldn't I have _one_ choice-of-law clause, the _best_ one I know of, for each state whose law I routinely choose?  Shouldn't that wording appear in nearly all my handiwork?  Shouldn't I at least _start_ with my best every time?

Of course, it gets worse.  What about bolt-on nondisclosure sections?  Or warranty disclaimers?  Indemnities?  Indemnity _procedures_?  The list goes on.  When opposing counsel drafts, I work with what I get, naturally.  But when _I'm_ sending out turn one, shouldn't it be my best work at the time?  Shouldn't my work, particularly the humdrum parts, read more consistently?

Review enough contracts, you get a feel for their piece-part structure.  Forms combine and apply general, recognizable components.  A software license is a license grant, express warranties, disclaimers, delivery obligations, boilerplate, and so on.  A consulting agreement is work terms, payment terms, independence reps, IP assignment terms, and so on.  Their net-30-payment clauses may be the same.

A good contract proposal is the right recipe and good ingredients, all brought together well: the right kinds of clauses, implemented in well crafted language, combined in a consistent, organized document.  Any failure of good composition brings the whole down.  A bad form can be well drafted and incomplete, complete but poorly drafted, or even complete, in each part well drafted, and haphazardly assembled.

Individually, deals lawyers get it.  But our understanding is widespread, not shared or common.  Apart from names for various recurring clauses---integration clause, damages exclusion, confidential information exceptions, and so on---the reusable nature of our work isn't reflected in our tools, procedures, or collaborative conventions.  That leaves our profession, as a system, well equipped to deliver only fully prepped, ready-to-eat documents with efficiency.  Assembly and revision of contract recipes, sourcing and assessment of contract ingredients, and procurement of contact making supplies remain peculiar to specific attorneys or practice groups, often ad hoc.

The most glaring manifestation is our failure to collaborate even with ourselves, individually, over time.  I've sent out myriad choice-of-law clauses, though I've taken the time to draft a few good ones, because I've lacked the processes and tools to reuse that work efficiently on other projects.  The Kyle E. Mitchell, attorney, who will prepare a contract tomorrow lacks the means to efficiently mooch off the Kyle E. Mitchell, attorney, who on a lark read up and [drafted a plain-language clause from the language of the case law months ago](https://commonform.org/goldplate/california-law/2e) for a different deal.  The cost of remembering that you have a good example component on-hand, remembering where you have it, actually finding it, lifting it out, inserting it into your current draft, and adapting it to fit often outweighs the benefit you expect replacing probably-good-enough with better.  Which is part of how we end up sending drafts riddled with known inadequacies, each inefficient to plug on its own, to clients.
