Open software feels stuck in a hole because it has dug itself into a hole.  Internet software culture has set itself off from the broader world socially, intellectually, and practically.  It has turned inward on itself for all apparent needs, and come up long on code and short everything else.

As the reality of thankless maintainership, business predation, and adoption for deplorable uses sets in for the GitHub generation, it's coming up short of meaning.  The old figureheads, foundations, firms, and faith tenets of free and open source no longer provide.

Following their lead keeps us alone.  Stroking our own egos keeps us alone.  Scratching our own itches keeps us alone.  Fetishizing autonomy and self-reference keeps us alone.  All that insularity has made software---free, open, and closed---a classic conspiracy against the laity.  The laity is pissed.  They don't hail their coders as liberators, but resign to their power as a foreign, mind-occupying force.

With a little outside perspective, the problem is obvious, and so are the solutions.  The opposite of conspiracy is service.  Public service, for others rather than ourselves.  Foreign service, far outside the software realm.  The opposite of isolation is connection.  Serve well and you get connection for free.

Meet other kinds of people, work with them closely, and scratch _their_ itches, rather than your own.  Praise others who do, and accept praise yourself when you've earned it.  Embrace frameworks for esteem and self-actualization, but only from a safe distance outside software.  Open yourself first, and learn who you're trying to help.  _Then_, maybe, think about software.

If we get out more, and listen to others---rather than preach a future in which we are even more an aloof ruling class---there will be plenty of service, connection, and meaning to be found.

## Simplicity, Suspecting

> While we can distinguish various nonfree distribution schemes in terms of how far they fall short of being free, we consider them all equally unethical.
>
> --- Richard Stallman, [_What is Free Software?_](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) as of [November 21, 2013](https://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/www/www/philosophy/free-sw.html?revision=1.125&view=markup)

Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.  When someone promises to make ethics simple, experience should make us skeptical.  The guru may get more from the title than they give.

I fear that has been free and open source software theory in my lifetime.  Its proponents donned ethical, philosophical, even religious vestments from early on.  But both honest analysis and common experience lay those pretensions bare.

Pervasive free and open source ideology oversimplifies hard ethical problems by reducing them to a single domain, software, and a single variable, freedom.  Hence "software freedom" as all-encompassing moral tautology.  We're all born free to compute as we please.  Neither computer programmers nor computer companies deserve to impinge.  If they uniformly didn't, life would be sweller.  Simple.

Almost no one's real-world morality boil down to "Can folks do what they wanna?"  What's right just isn't so black-and-white.

Almost no one's real-world experience exalts mankind as saints sadly constrained by circumstance.  Life just isn't so simple.

Almost no one's real-world politics boils down to "Do folks have an absolute right to do _X_?", where _X_ is speech, assembly, religion, arms, contract, take your pick.  Justice just isn't so straightforward.

I care for those near to me.  I value loyalty, respect, and fairness.  I cherish connections to higher meanings and purposes.  And yes, I enjoy my liberty, and not mostly in software.  But I seek a balance of those concerns when they conflict, as they often do.

It's complicated.  That's life, and most of the fun.

## Horribles, Parading

> When asking the question "When is it wrong (or right) to use closed-source software?", we should treat it the same way we treat every other ethical question.  First, by being very clear about what harmful consequences we wish to avoid; second, by reasoning from the avoidance of harm to a rule that is minimal and restricts peoples' choices as little as possible.
>
> --- Eric Raymond, [_Evaluating the Harm from Closed Source_](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4371)

I've seen black-and-white software freedom stoke disregard, devaluation, and abuse of people who make software.  I've seen developers browbeaten into slapping licenses on their work, under coordinated social pressure, not for their benefit, or for any concrete greater good, but for the benefit of those beating brow.  I've seen bug reports demanding features and fixes gush entitlement â€¦ and nary a drop of gratitude.  Lots of them.

All of that is profoundly mean.  Blindly maximizing software freedom, privileging one set of people over another because we deem them "users", compromises basic human decency.  Nobody wants to join a movement that abuses them.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom birth a successive embodiment of emergent business models---O'Reilly, Red Hat, Amazon, whatever comes next---adept at reaping the value of projects they did not sow.  I've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with growing projects, only to be outdone by runaway incumbents wherever they turned for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  I've seen those firms work, consciously and by competitive pressure, to trumpet freedoms that play to their advantages, elide freedoms that level their playing field, and shape the meaning of "free" and "open" to like effect.

All of that is profoundly unjust.  Blindly maximizing software freedom compromises essential fairness.  Nobody wants to play a game stacked against them, even if they never really wanted to win.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable powerful user-come-latelys to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers.  I've seen burned out developers replaced by fresh blood waiting in the wings, projects marginalized and threatened with hostile forks from consortia of household names, and new ideas eclipsed by clones from highly paid hirelings while the original devs flailed.  I've seen the norm of credit for developers behind projects fall from expectation to broadly ignored license chore to "proprietary" sin.

All of this is profoundly disrespectful, often intimately disloyal.  Blindly maximizing freedom compromises respect and authority.  Nobody wants to join a community as disposable human sacrifice.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable takers to turn makers' work against the very things that inspired them in the first place.  I've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into surveillance, and cryptosystems into boiler-room scams.  I've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using share-alike tools without a single new line of free code to show for it.

All of this saps developers' sense of nobility and calling.  Blindly maximizing freedom compromises purpose.  Nobody wants to do free labor for the baddies, or to pour their work down a gaping moral void.

All of this is the interdependence of values in action.  When the only value we measure is freedom, freedom expands to fill all available space, choking loyalty, respect, fairness, purpose, even basic human decency.  This happens whenever a community picks one value and hammers on it.  Free and open praxis at scale demonstrates the costs of dogmatic liberalism in software just as clearly as its benefits.  Ditto Section 230, the law lets Web platforms off the hook for content they host.

I don't parade horribles to paint a one-sided picture of free or open source software.  I've written at length on how "open" writ large has done me good turns.  It still does.

Well worn narratives extol the benefits of free and open source software.  Those narratives won out in part by ignoring and downplaying any costs.  The costs remain scattered, without a story, anecdotal.  Despite widespread firsthand experience.  One great narrative trumps a few merely accurate ones any day.

Laying both costs and benefits out dry presents a stark choice:  Do we write off the costs for the benefits?  Do we ignore the benefits in light of the costs?  Or do we try to weigh and balance?  If we weigh and balance, how?  GPLv3?  Who will benefit by our decision?  RMS?  Grandma?

Secrecy, restrictions, and limited access threatened hackers' freedom, empowerment, and reverence for the new interactive computing machines.  So the truest believers launched a counterattack, first as free software, now as its leaner, fitter mutant, open source.  Open source claims victory.  But the widespread use of its methods---open licenses, methodologies, governance, platforms, and tools---by the same sorts of companies free was software was meant to resist again threatens hackers' ability to frame their hacking as contribution to a better world.  When the rest of the world isn't buying it anymore, hackers' prerogative to stay glued to their screens all the time falls to question.

A new generation of programming addicts has more Internet, source code, and social legitimacy than early hackers could've dreamed.  But many are turning away from the figureheads, foundations, firms, and faith tenets of free and open source.  At a basic level, they want what computer bums have always wanted: justification for more computer time.  But they're comparatively sated now, and moving quicker and more often up the hierarchy of needs.

We want to feel good about software we use, software we make, how we make it, and who we make it with.  We need morality to tell us we're good, philosophy to tell us we matter, and ideology to tell us we're right about ourselves.  But good morality, philosophy, and ideology don't come from other software junkies.  Good morality, philosophy, and ideology aren't hobby- or industry-specific.

Some aim to reform open source pragmatics, hoping an even opener open source will sound out new wells of meaning and respect.  Some seek to revive free software ethics out of reverence for the supposed purity of its idealized, precommercial form.  But the lived experience of taking new ideas back to the old school hasn't been free-flowing rejuvenation, but brusque rejection, even excommunication.  The thick moral, technical, and political gloss slathered on to justify and edify free open and open development in retrospect doesn't apply prospectively to anything that might fork the state of play.  The old moral, technical, and political justifications "worked".  Those well served now see them as desirably stable dependencies, the tap for a trickle of new contributors, not levers of change.

They were never levers of change.  Change came first.  The tools, licenses, and conventions of open development preceded the definitions, essays, and institutions of open politics.  The latter coincided with a self-conscious marketing campaign and the balance of power it occasioned.  They were magic words.  Crack them open and you'll let their smoke out.

Living through this realization teaches that open-source ideology, free-software morality, and the conflicts between them were never the question or the answer.  That's category error.  Each side has refuted the other:  [Making source open doesn't inevitably make it better.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er1pM9suxvE)  [Making software free doesn't make `git push` a virtuous act.](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/11/17/VC-Shill)  But believing one, the other, or both opportunistically justifies and aggrandizes what developers want to do on a far more basic level: sling code, never hearing "no", among their fellow obsessed.  Justifying those means _is_ the end.

## Ego, Stroking

> If you think moral reasoning is something we do to figure out the truth, you'll be constantly frustrated by how foolish, biased, and illogical people become when they disagree with you.  But if you think about moral reasoning as a skill we humans evolved to further our social agendas---to justify our own actions and to defend the teams we belong to---then things will make a lot more sense.  Keep your eye on the intuitions, and don't take people's moral arguments at face value.  They are mostly post hoc constructions made up on the fly, crafted to advance one or more strategic objectives.

I accepted delusions of ethical grandeur and loose use of weighty words like "philosophy" because they imbued my personal choices about software, well within my control, even in childhood, with outsize meaning and importance.  They enabled me to believe I was gifted, rather than hooked.  They enabled me to believe that my use of a copyright license, or even my taste in other peoples' software, amounted to countercultural, charitable, even revolutionary acts.

They did not.  Except in the eyes of the similarly seduced.

A glancing comparison to nearly any other source of moral teaching available would have revealed how simplistic that line of thinking was.  Moral philosophy remains messy, frustrating, and humbling, like engineering, medicine, social work, and any other discipline accountable to the muck and mire of reality.  Moral codes come riddled with exceptions, littered with factors to weigh and balance.  Software freedom asks little, delivers clarity, feels great, and promises empowerment.  It boils down to one long boolean `AND` predicate:  Do you have all the freedoms, or not?

Too good to be true is easy to spot, unless it's too good for _you_.  Software freedom was very good to me.  It _felt_ better, even though it was worse.  But I wasn't accountable to anyone, except to myself, so my feelings won out over any kind of consistency.  Until the reality checks.  Lots of them.  Over decades.

Enabling facts are welcome.  Inconvenient facts are not.  When software-freedom absolutism indirectly facilitates a good outcome in any other dimension, the true believer happily credits the cause.  Given absolute freedom, they tell us to expect all good to follow.  But when software freedom takes a toll, the faithful blame the victim.  You shouldn't have made it open source ... like I told you to.  You didn't do it open enough ... my way.  You didn't do it for the right reasons ... my reasons.  You didn't use the right tools ... my tools.  The more enlightened, who speak from one side of their mouths, write off as collateral damage.

At one point or another, I've brandished all these too-handy weapons.  I was reassuring myself more than criticizing the other, but still very much at the other's expense.

Just as computer programming reduces complex problems down to computable approximations, ethical and political conversations trapped within software, which only step outside to grab glittering generalities like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable program for a bad approximation of life.  Just as software reductionism looses well-intentioned, malign systems on the world, reductionism makes wanton, antisocial automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinkered or indifferent to predictable consequences.  When good theory starts from bad assumptions, applying that theory to the world, or force-fitting the world to suit, makes causalities.

Trading completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity often means trading hard decisions and balanced outcomes for easy decisions and predictable carnage.  "It depends" is often correct, but never pleasant to hear.  But the comfort of pop theory, of easy certainty, so easily becomes the surest sign of truth, and therefore virtue.  Programmers pare rightness down to Turing-esque, deductive, boolean reasoning---freedom or no freedom---because left to ourselves, we select for the story that pleases us most, not those on the receiving end, who we've thoroughly abstracted away.

Until you cross the line from open source taker to open source maker.  Until you realize you'll be subject to the decisions of others more often than they'll be subject to yours.  Until you face your dependence and your interdependence, master of machine though you may be.

## Revolution, Reacting

> Rules which prevent you from taking matters ... into your own hands are too ridiculous to even consider abiding by.  ... When [the Tech Model Railroad Club] needed a set of diodes, or some extra relays, to build some new feature into The System, a few S&P people would wait until dark and find their way into the places where those things were kept.  None of the hackers, who were as a rule scrupulously honest in other matters, seemed to equate this with "stealing."  A willful blindness.
>
> --- Steven Levy, _Hackers_

Those who feel victimized by others go readily all-in on the values---liberty, care, fairness, and so on---denied to them.  That exclusive focus implicitly scoffs that other values protect anyone but the villains and their cronies.  In time, after much doubling down, that antipathy takes explicit form.

Often the process manifests as vilification of a single, identifiable font of all affront, be it government, business, "godless communism", or "late capitalism".  The variously aggrieved may unite not around the particular values they expound, but the symbolic villains they blame.

All these mindsets come from life, and all the lessons informing them come from experience.  But extremism is ugly in all its forms.  No-common-denominator specialization in values yields an unworkable politics of reciprocal, exhibitionist shouting, cathartic until the other tribe yells back, shattering the fantasy of decisive, total domination, kickstarting the cycle anew.  Meanwhile, all the noise easily drowns out any holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated seekers whose taste runs to far more sensitive deliberation, and who deal far less splash damage, and commit less friendly fire.  There's no air left for nuance.

Software freedom obsession naturally results from unexplained, opaque software freedom impingement.  With the right (or wrong) reinforcement, it can readily outstrip its original stimulus.  Vilification of a symbol---IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, industry generally---readily follows.

That doesn't make the obsessed or the vilifying fools.  It confirms them as human.  But human intuitions aren't slow, subtle, or rational.  Without deep social discourse and lots of time, intellect can at best recover after the short fuses or our prejudice burns down.  Those conditioned to bristle at "no" for an answer to literally any question about software will bristle.  They may reason themselves down from there.  They may not.

We have heard a lot of shouting in free and open software politics.  Having another tribe to yell at has been defining for both.  Bringing that opposition _within_ the culture, especially online, proved far more self-sustaining, interactive, and compelling than taking on industry through traditional media.  But all the blaring has largely drowned out those attempting to bring comparatively robust moralities and ideologies from without software within it.

Software wanted its ego stroked with a higher sense of purpose.  As it turns out, the easiest way to get our egos strokes was to stroke them ourselves.  Gratification was easy when software philosophy exalted every release under the right form license, with no expectation of or mechanism for accountable end-user feedback, as a charitable or revolutionary act.  But as a greater number of programmers ventured outside and reported back on the unintentional, negative effects of self-justifying software on society, satisfaction got harder and harder to defend.  The motions are there, but the mood is gone.

This phenomenon was not contained to theory or politics.

## Itches, Scratching

> Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
>
> --- Eric Raymond, [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html)

> "This is it ... this is where I belong..."  I know everyone here ... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again ... I know you all ...
>
> --- Loyd "The Mentor" Blankenship, [_The Conscience of a Hacker_](http://www.phrack.org/issues/7/3.html#article), 1986

Writing software for yourself and others like you bypasses all the hardest parts of making software.  That can and does produce some good results, within the tribe.  But a terrible price: reinforcing personal isolation and the insularity of programming overall.

Developing tools for development by fellow developers makes a pretty nice kit, or at least a large and very full one.  But it flexes none of the necessary muscles for understanding people, writing the software they need, and confirming their needs are well and truly met.

Eliciting requirements and feedback isn't necessary when the requirements and feedback are your own.  Accountability happens all in one head.  So communication atrophies to the acerbic, confrontational engineering tone software is so known for.

Ensuring your work actually satisfies a need happens inevitably when you satisfy yourself.  So a thousand web frameworks bloomed while encryption remained impractical for the average Jane or Joe.

Learning and leveraging new platforms, venues, and communication styles doesn't happen when you pick your platform, venue, and communication style of first choice over and over again.  GitHub hasn't taken off as a general-purpose collaboration tool outside software, and the more software-specific features it piles on, the more niched it feels.

Access to programming at an early age, and therefore programming addiction, correlates tightly with specific social and demographic factors.  So communing with others addicted to programming often means communing with others very similar more broadly.  The result is a community riding the edge of monoculture.  Monocultures are often productive ... until they're utterly compromised.

Not-programmer people didn't do this to programmers.  Not-programmer people are clamoring for programmer help.  Programming did all of this to itself.

## Conspiracy, Identifying

> People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.
>
> --- Adam Smith, _The Wealth of Nations_

There's nothing inherently wrong with itch scratching projects, with projects that happen to serve programmers, or with projects under permissive licenses doing wholly indeterminate good.  But there is less individually swell about them than we've given ourselves credit for, and strong cause for concern about their effects overall.  When we understand how our individual works add up, we become responsible for our contributions.

One of those effects has been a large, growing, and increasingly formalized inequality between programmers and non-programmers.  Software developers expect, even loudly demand, that tools to their taste be free, beer and freedom.  As a group, they pillory peers who dare to undermine that norm with requests for payment or even lower-friction substitutes like ads.  In other words, developers abhor in the developer-software market what they routinely demand in markets for everyone else.  Collegiality in the guild hall, bruising commercialism outside its doors.

We see similar patterns in terms apart from compensation.  Copyleft is begrudgingly tolerated, politically if not operationally, in open software at large.  Until it threatens to cross the community-industry barrier.  Popular projects under once-strong copyleft terms, such as Linux and GCC, come with specially drafted legal exceptions designed to exempt applications built with from sharing alike.  Licenses beefing up copyleft to cover the primary use cases of dev tools aren't receive a heretic's fiery welcome.

These phenomenon aren't lost on outside commentators.

If Adam Smith had mentioned lowering costs or raising margins, and not just raising prices, he'd have covered open source and the software industry as most of the software dependent see it today.  Whether developers _intend_ to conspire, the effect is the same.  Lots of open collaboration among coders, but no such welcome for anyone else.  Lots of free software that coders can use, but not much software for others without big strings attached.  Lots of appreciation for freedom and nonexploitation, but transmission of software's insights to society by business cultures at long remove from that experience, reliably hostile to it, and self-consciously committed to doing differently unto their "resources" than their customers do unto them.

## Service, Inviting

> When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely.
>
> --- Green Day, ["Longview"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42BBdzzgPNM)

The opposite of conspiracy is service.  The antidote to anomie is connection.  The route around unfaithful messengers---business and other institutions deciding whether and how the software arts will reach society and distribute rewards---is delivering the message yourself.

If you feel isolated, reach out to people who need software, directly.  If you're ready to listen and help, rather than lecture or preach, you'll be welcomed by the kind of people you want to work with.  Computers are, after all, pretty useful.  People who listen moreso.

Hackers seeking a richer kind of collaboration, respect for their role as accomplished specialist, reassurance about the good use and effect of their work, and a higher sense of purpose would do well to include people who _aren't_ programmers in their day-to-day, as deeply and as often as possible.  They'd do well to seek out frameworks for justification, meaning, and purpose in their work that range much more broadly than software.  And they'd do well by their lonely fellow travelers to encourage the same.

Serving others who _don't_ share your expertise, culture, or lifestyle represents a distinct and important skill.  It's harder than naming things, and must be practiced.  It is not just requirements, user stories, focus groups, and testing.  It is far more than those things, and more than all of them combined.

To develop new skill and strength, follow the usual program.  Reorder your priorities, and flow them down into your time.  Strong swimmers clock a lot of fast laps.  Good negotiators close a lot of tough deals.  Good grief counselors listen through a lot of pain.  Coders who work well with others work a lot of projects with others.

The difficulty of those skills makes them valuable.  Getting started takes discipline.  But once the virtuous loop of struggle, success, and noticeable progress closes, practice becomes play, discipline becomes avocation, and you find yourself getting really, really good at something.  Something that others can value.  Something that can connect you to richer veins of purpose.

## Program, Proposing

Only the tools, techniques, memes, and organizational forms of software stand on their own.  They aren't going anywhere.  But their heady ideological associations are no more than labels, which wear off in short order under any consistent use.  Free isn't going to win out over open.  The closer open gets to winning out over free, the more free spirit comes out of hibernation.  But this or that flavor of retroactive continuity won't change the plot already laid down in Internet history.  It won't change the tools, their leverage, or their limitations.

The next great leaps in method, inspiration, and productivity will riff on free and open tools, techniques, memes, and organizations as prior art.  They won't build on their post hoc ideologies, or fit on the free-open line.  New stories will motivate people to try them.  New narratives will justify their results ... after the fact.

My thrust here is general, but it's easy to make concrete.  Here is my personal plan.

_Prestige_:  I have consciously reordered my hierarchy of cool.  Kernels, compilers, languages, and dev tools are no longer the projects I admire most.  They are merely the kinds of projects I understand best, great plays in games on the order of checkers.  The less the need met is a need I think the programmer related to before starting the project, the more I admire the programmer.

_Projects_:  I have begun to prioritize programming projects that serve non-programmers' needs, rather than my own.  Especially when I can be in close communication with the person or group of people hoping to use the application, from conception through deployment and maintenance.  I seek the closest working relationships I can get, as far from my native culture as I can be useful.

_Pairs_:  In programmer-to-programmer work, I am learning to see fellow programmers much as a I see fellow lawyers: as powerful but fundamentally incomplete halves.  Q, not James Bond, and definitely not Rambo.  I am asking fellow programmers who they're working for, and to introduce the people they serve.  I am asking "my" people to introduce me, rather than to introduce myself, whenever possible, and to keep them involved in discussions directly.

_Platforms_:  I am learning to prioritize others' choice of collaborative platforms and tools over programming-specific alternatives, and learning to speak their languages, instead of teaching mine.  Discourse over GitHub.  Texts over IRC.  There are incredible unmet needs for collaboration tools general enough to accommodate coders, designers, other specialists, and the generalists who make their specialities matter.  But unless and until they arrive, good coder-user collaboration is far more important than coder comfort.  Frankly, I think it'll probably be _less_ fun for me when it's all figured out.

_Praise_:  I am making a point to praise peers that I see actively and accountably practicing what I preach.  And I am learning to graciously accept compliments when I do so.  I strive to both be and to reinforce the kind of good software and the software-using world need so desperately need now.  That's a tall order, but I'm learning to fail trying, rather than give up.

## Dependence, Selecting

>  Freedom means having control over your own life.  If you use a program to carry out activities in your life, your freedom depends on your having control over the program.  You deserve to have control over the programs you use, and all the more so when you use them for something important in your life.
>
> --- Richard Stallman, [_Free Software is Even More Important Now_](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html)

If you go out, others will depend on you.  You will be directly accountable to them.  Your conscience won't fail to notice.

Reading through the theorizations of free software and open source, it's easy to trace a missing thread:  Everybody was going to be a programmer.  Everybody was going to want to be.  After all, in the early days, there was no running programs without entering the sanctum of the computer lab.  It's not an addiction if everyone's in on it.  Air, water, and carbohydrates aren't controlled substances.

Some professions have gone universal.  Scribes, for example, for the most part.  But everyday life is littered with professions that haven't dissolved away into the populist baseline.

I hold out great hope that non-lawyers will do more of their own legal work.  But I don't expect that everyone will, or that artificial intelligence will substitute entire.  I'm no doctor, dentist, priest, and so on, but I doubt they expect the same for their own callings.  I haven't asked, but I don't think my barber, office janitor, or insurance agent nurse fear imminent obsolescence, either.  There are things in my life that I need and receive, but take no greater part in.

These older callings don't tend to harbor univariate freedom movements, like software.  Some theorists have gone there, but not many have followed.  That makes sense.  Life and mental space hit their limits.  If every specialty, every fascination, set itself up as a universal vocation, rather than an available collaborator, with a fully serious definition of "free" really focused on "users", "users" would throw up the white flag.  Specialization is indeed for insects, but mastery is for one life at a time.  Dilettantism brings great joy, but there's no great demand for dilettante dentistry or welding divers.

I am no less free for relying on others to live my life.  I am in a sense less independent.  But I revel in the choice of my dependencies and the connectedness they bring.  I'm grateful for the willingness and availability of others to take control over aspects of my life, and to steward them better than I would alone.  I'm grateful for the unprompted, often utterly unrelated conversations and interactions that having people do those things produces.

My life is richer for it.  All the care, the history, the wonkishness that I put into a license, a policy, or a contract for a client, I can see in the people and work that I rely on.  I can prattle on for hours about computer keyboards, copyleft, and contract law.  When I ask my dental hygienist about the Cavitron, or the x-ray blanket, or what "SLS" means in toothpaste, it's clear they've made a life in dentistry, and that there's a whole life to be made in there somehow.  When I ask my barber about the differences between Korean, Vancouver, and American fashion, I get an earful, in English---an extra effort for a Vietnamese boat person.

I'm tempted to preach openness to these people as I know it.  There is something to that:  They may not have considered rowing that directly upstream of the rules and regulations of their work.  It's not an obvious tactic.

But most have showed me every kind of openness that I have ever asked for.  They gladly answer questions of nearly any kind, including questions that allow me to do more for myself, without them.  Their willingness to answer seems tempered, if at all, by concern that I'll take undue risks with a novice hand, complicating their plan to serve me well, and concern for the responsibility they might bear for choices not entirely their own.  But it is just because of the trust their answers build that I usually choose to deepen, rather than deviate from, the trust relationship we have built.

It's the same with my law clients today.  Every opportunity to show my work is not a relationship risk, but an invitation to renew our alliance.  Likewise for my software clients, in a past life.
