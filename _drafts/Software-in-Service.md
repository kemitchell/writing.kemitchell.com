The old schools of open software love to talk trash.  To hear Free Software tell it, Open Source strips Free Software of its values, sucking up to the nonfree industry with promises of cheaper code, for cash and popularity.  To hear Open Source tell it, Free Software isn't really any different from Open Source, just preached too much fire and brimstone, missed a rebrand, and lost out.

You don't have to toe either line.  And you can still have plenty to say about the broader importance of software and openness in the modern world.

Many prolific open software developers do.  When they speak up, they don't sound like like impassioned freedom fundamentalists, or like salesman at a trade show.  They speak like public servants, answering a calling.  Like them, you may believe that open is good because open makes software better and that software ought to be good for the people it serves.  You might look down on closed software because it's less good than it could be without putting "open or closed?" before "useful or not?".

If you see software development as a kind of public service, even if you've never thought in those terms, you are not alone.  But you aren't represented, either.  And for that you and your kind pay a price.

# Either-Org

For folks not feeling either major open-software party strongly, the result, socially and politically, looks like a stark moral choice.  Become a rabid Free Software fundamentalist, install Utoto, shut off JavaScript, and start lecturing your friends and family.  Or become a busy Open Source drone-bee, land an enterprise gig, pillage hapless non-techies, and buy something nice for your mid-life crisis.  You needn't feel bad about either.  Just be sure to keep company of your kind, which won't be hard, because conferences, companies, and even various corners of the Web fly the flags of their types pretty openly.

But "None of the Above" is also an option.  Find out where the partisans loiter, avoid them, and keep coding.  If you find yourself in an ideological ambush, do your best blank-slate impression, and let them talk themselves out.  Nod your head until they let you get back to work.

The Good News: The tire fire of the free-or-open debate can burn right along without you for fuel.

The Bad News: You will suffer decision without representation, over and over again, because the major parties are fully engaged in all the major institutions, from foundations to companies to consensus-constructed working groups, and your view isn't.

Name a community group speaking up for developers of permissively licensed software against demanding users building lousy proprietary software?  I wish I could.  Name a community group promoting, developing, and safeguarding models for small businesses that want to do pure open work?  I don't know of one.  Name a community group marshaling legal talent to make tools and answer questions for keeping code open, without political fuss? There wasn't one, so we had to [make one](https://blueoakcouncil.org).  Name a community group publishing standards and inspiration for aesthetic, architectural, and poetic achievement in software, rather than company-pleasing "maintainer do" lists?  Maybe [suckless](https://suckless.org), fifteen years ago?

# Both-Either

I know more than a few open-quality radicals.  Many stay abreast of politics, and know their way around a collective-action problem.  What accounts for their lack of organization?

Those who believe good software is _right_, that bad software is _wrong_, and that open makes software better, so software ought to be open, can get recognition for a bit of their view, here and there, from each incumbent party.  From Free Software they can take moral dissatisfaction with nonfree software, and a desire to compete with and replace it.  From Open Source they can take the importance of quality and process, and respect for software's role as a tool or means to real-world ends beyond software itself.

Trouble is, those bits never come as a package.  Rather, they come packaged with other views.  Developers use copyleft licenses like GPL to keep their work open, but those licenses [preach lots they don't believe in](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#preamble), [work only half well for getting patches back](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2018/08/28/Unhappy-Coincidences.html#software-freedom-doesnt-mean-patches-back), and [come deliberately crippled with loopholes](https://blog.licensezero.com/2018/09/14/free-to-take-freedom.html) for reasons related to Free Software ideology.  Developers use permissive licenses to avoid the hassle of GPL compliance, thereby [shooting their companies in the feet](https://redislabs.com/press/commons-clause-stops-open-source-abuse/), [empowering uses they find morally repugnant](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/pull/1616), and accepting integration into shoddy proprietary products, because those were goals or acceptable collateral damage to the stewards of those licenses.

These faults are fairly easy to see in license terms, since those are well documented.  But the dynamic plays out in myriad ways.  The quality-focused coder learns to make do on half-measures: the right tool, optimized for somebody else's use case, inevitably ill-suited to particular needs of their own.  Everything but the software feels broken.

# Unsettled

There's no reason this outlook ought to settle for scraps off other parties' tables.  The view is consistent, and compelling, on its own.  In fact, it responds better and more clearly to many pressing issues in software.

For years, the popular press has gushed stories about surveillance, invasion of privacy, and the scurrilous practices of data- and ad-based software businesses.  Unlike Open Source, the the new view criticizes those companies from a position of principle.  Software can and should be built to afford control and protection of personal data.  Unlike Free Software, the new view can criticize in the same terms that offended users employ.  Proprietary social networks are _broken_ insofar as they abuse users and squander what trust they're given, by poor design and insecure practice.  There's no call to drive the conversation away from privacy toward a jargon-leaden, highly abstract notion of software freedom, and then back into privacy by exhorting auntie to learn Unix and patch her social network.

For years, both Free Software and Open Source have extolled the power of programmers working on problems that call to them, rather than problems to which they're assigned.
