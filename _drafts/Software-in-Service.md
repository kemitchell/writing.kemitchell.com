Open software feels stuck in a hole because it has dug itself into one.  Internet software culture has set itself off from the broader world socially, intellectually, and practically.  It has turned inward on itself for all apparent needs, and come up short of nearly everything but code.  As the reality of thankless maintainership, business predation, and adoption for deplorable uses sets in, open software is coming up short of meaning.

Stroking our own egos keeps us alone.  Scratching our own itches keeps us alone.  Fetishizing autonomy and self-reference keeps us alone.  That program has made software---free, open, and closed---a classic conspiracy against the laity.  And the laity is pissed.

With a little outside perspective, the problem is obvious, and so are the solutions.  Meet other kinds of people, work with them closely, and scratch _their_ itches, rather than our own.  Embrace frameworks for esteem self-actualization, but from well outside software.  Open your code, if that seems wise to do, but not before you open yourself.

The opposite of conspiracy is service.  Public service, for others rather than ourselves.  Foreign service, far outside the software realm.  The connections service brings can and will change software.  Connections cure isolation.

The question is isn't what to do, but whether open software can get out more, stop lecturing the rest of society when it does, and learn the discipline it needs to reintegrate into the world.  But who needs discipline for a problem they can't see?

## Simplicity, Suspecting

> When asking the question "When is it wrong (or right) to use closed-source software?", we should treat it the same way we treat every other ethical question.  First, by being very clear about what harmful consequences we wish to avoid; second, by reasoning from the avoidance of harm to a rule that is minimal and restricts peoples' choices as little as possible.

Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.  When someone promises to make ethics simple, experience should make us skeptical.  The guru may get more from the title more than they give to right living or good theory.

I fear that has been free and open source software theory in my lifetime.  Its proponents donned ethical, philosophical, even religious vestments from early on.  But both honest analysis and common experience lay those pretensions bare.

Pervasive free and open source ideology oversimplifies hard ethical problems by reducing them to a single domain, software, and a single variable, freedom.  Hence "software freedom" as all-encompassing moral tautology.  We're all born free to compute as we please.  Neither computer programmers nor computer companies deserve to impinge.  If they uniformly didn't, life would be sweller.  So the story goes.

Almost no one's real-world morality boils down to "Can folks do what they wanna?"  What's right just isn't so black-and-white.

Almost no one's real-world experience exalts mankind as saints sadly constrained by circumstance.  Life just isn't so simple.

Almost no one's real-world politics boils down to "Do folks have an absolute right to do _X_?", where _X_ is speech, assembly, religion, arms, contract, conscience, or the like.  Justice just isn't so straightforward.

I care for those near to me.  I value loyalty, respect, and fairness.  I cherish connections to higher meanings and purposes.  And yes, I enjoy my liberty, and not mostly in software.  But I seek a balance of those concerns when they conflict, as they often do.  I am not alone.

## Horribles, Parading

I've seen black-and-white software freedom stoke disregard, devaluation, and abuse of people who make software.  I've seen developers browbeaten into slapping licenses on their work not for their own benefit, or for any concrete greater good, but for the benefit of those beating brow.  I've seen bug reports demanding features and fixes gush entitlement … and nary a drop of gratitude.  Lots of them.

All of that is profoundly mean.  Blindly maximizing software freedom, privileging one set of people over another because we deem them "users", compromises basic human care.  Nobody wants to join a movement that fills their life with abuse.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom birth dominant firms---O'Reilly, Red Hat, Amazon---adept at reaping value of projects they did not sow.  I've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with growing projects, only to be outdone by runaway incumbents wherever they turned for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  I've seen those firms work, consciously and by competitive pressure, to trumpet the freedoms that play to their advantages, elide the freedoms that level their playing field, and guide the meaning of "free" and "open" to the same effect.

All of that is profoundly unfair.  Blindly maximizing software freedom compromises essential fairness.  Nobody wants to play a game stacked against them, even if they never wanted a win.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable powerful user-come-latelys to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. I've seen burned out developers replaced by fresh blood waiting in the wings, projects marginalized and threatened with hostile forks from consortia of household names, and new ideas eclipsed by clones from hirelings making bank while the original developers flailed.  I've seen the norm of credit for developers behind projects fall from expected condition to broadly ignored chore to "proprietary" mortal sin.

All of this is profoundly disrespectful, often intimately disloyal.  Blindly maximizing freedom compromises respect and authority.  Nobody wants to join a community as disposable human sacrifice.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable takers to turn makers' work against the very things that inspired them in the first place.  I've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into surveillance, and cryptosystems into boiler-room scams.  I've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using share-alike tools without a single new line of free source code to show for it.

All of this saps developers' sense of nobility in work.  Blindly maximizing freedoms compromises purpose.  Nobody wants to do free labor for the baddies, or to pour their life's work into a thankless void.

All of this is the interdependence of values in action.  When the only value we measure is freedom, freedom expands to fill all available space, choking loyalty, respect, fairness, purpose, and even basic human decency.  This happens whenever a community puts one value above all.  Free and open praxis at scale demonstrates the costs of that absolutism just as clearly as its benefits.

I don't parade horribles to paint a one-sided picture of free or open source software.  I've written at length on how "open" writ large has improved my life and the lives of others.  It still does.

Well worn narratives extol the benefits of free and open source software, while we still recount the costs anecdotally, unsystematically.  The popular narratives won out in part by eliding or downplaying those costs.  The dearth of a downsides narrative persists in that shadow, despite widespread personal experience.

Laying costs and benefits out presents a stark choice:  Do we write off the costs for the benefits?  Do we ignore the benefits in light of the costs?  Or do we try to weigh and balance?  If we weigh and balance, how?  GPLv3?  Who will benefit by our decision?  RMS?

Secrecy, restrictions, and limited access threatened hackers' freedom, empowerment, and reverence for the new interactive computing machines.  So the truest believers launched a counterattack, first as free software, now best known as open source.  That movement claims victory today.  But the widespread use of its methods---open licenses, methodologies, governance, platforms, and tools---by the same sorts of companies they were designed to resist again threatens hackers' ability to frame their hacking as contribution to a better world.

A new generation of programming addicts has more access, Internet, and source code than early hackers might've dreamed.  But many are turning away from the figureheads, foundations, firms, and faith tenets of free and open source.  At a basic level, they want what programming addicts have always wanted.  But they're relatively sated now, and moving up the hierarchy of needs.

We want to feel good about software we use, software we make, how we make it, and who we make it with.  We need morality to tell us we're good, philosophy to tell us we matter, and ideology to tell us we're right about ourselves.  But good morality, philosophy, and ideology don't come from other software junkies.  Good morality, philosophy, and ideology aren't hobby- or industry-specific.

Some aim to reform open source pragmatics, hoping an even opener open source will cure its own ills.  Some seek to revive free software ethics out of reverence for its idealized, precommercial form.  But the lived experience of taking new ideas back to any old school hasn't been free-flowing deliberation, but brusque rejection and swift social condemnation.  The thick moral, technical, and political language slathered on to justify and edify free open and open development in retrospect doesn't apply prospectively to anything that might fork the state of play, rather than debug it.  The moral, technical, and political justifications "worked".  Those served by their success now see them as desirably stable dependencies, not levers of change.

They were never levers of change.  Change came first.  The tools, licenses, and conventions of open development precedent the definitions, essays, and institutions of open politics.

The lived experience of that realization teaches that open-source ideology, free-software morality, and the conflicts between them were never the question or the answer.  That's category error.  [Making source open doesn't inevitably make it better.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er1pM9suxvE)  [Making software free doesn't make `git push` a virtuous act.](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/11/17/VC-Shill.html)  But believing so justifies and aggrandizes what developers want to do on a far more basic level: sling code, free-range, among the fellow obsessed.  Justifying those means _is_ the end.

Only the tools, techniques, and organizations of software stand on their own.  The tools, techniques, and organizations of free and open source software aren't going anywhere.  But they are only just that.  Free isn't going to win out over open.  Open may be closer to winning out over free.  But this or that flavor of retroactive continuity won't change the plot already laid down.

The next great leaps in method, inspiration, and productivity will build on free and open tools, techniques, and organizations as prior art.  They won't build on their ideologies, or fit on the old free-open line.  New stories will motivate them.  New narratives will justify those that succeed.


## Egos, Stroking

> If you think moral reasoning is something we do to figure out the truth, you'll be constantly frustrated by how foolish, biased, and illogical people become when they disagree with you.  But if you think about moral reasoning as a skill we humans evolved to further our social agendas---to justify our own actions and to defend the teams we belong to---then things will make a lot more sense.  Keep your eye on the intuitions, and don't take people's moral arguments at face value.  They are mostly post hoc constructions made up on the fly, crafted to advance one or more strategic objectives.

I accepted delusions of ethical grandeur and loose use of weighty words like "philosophy" because they imbued my personal choices about software, well within my control, even in childhood, with outsize meaning and importance.  They enabled me to believe that my use of a copyright license, or even my taste in other peoples' software, amounted to countercultural, charitable, even revolutionary acts.

They did not.  Except in the views of others similarly seduced to self-aggrandizement.

A glancing comparison to nearly any other source of moral teaching available to me would have revealed how simplistic that line of thinking was.  Moral philosophy remains messy, frustrating, and humbling, like engineering, medicine, social work, and any other discipline accountable to the muck and mire of reality.  Moral codes come riddled with exceptions, littered with factors to weigh and balance.  Software freedom asks little, delivers clarity, feels great, and promises empowerment.  It boils down to one long boolean `AND` predicate:  Do you have all the freedoms, or not?

Too good to be true is easy to spot, unless it's too good for _you_.  Software freedom was very good to me.  It _felt_ better, even though it was worse.  But I wasn't accountable to anyone, except to myself, so feelings won out.  Until the reality checks.  Lots of them.

Useful facts are welcome, and exaggerated.  Contrary facts are not.  When software-freedom absolutism indirectly facilitates a good outcome in any other dimension, true believers happily credit their cause.  Given absolute freedom, they tell us to expect much good to follow.  But when software freedom takes a toll, the faithful blame the victim or write them off as collateral damage.  You shouldn't have done open source ... like we told you to.  You didn't do it open enough ... my way.  You didn't do it for the right reasons ... my reasons.  You didn't use the right tools ... my tools.

At one point or another, I've brandished all these too-convenient criticisms.  I was defending myself more than criticizing the other, but still very much at their expense.

Just as computer programming reduces complex problems down to computable approximations, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside to grab glittering generalities like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a bad approximation of life.  Just as software reductionism looses well-intentioned, malign systems on the world, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinkered or indifferent to predictable consequences.  When good theory starts from bad assumptions, applying that theory on the world, or forcing the world to fit it, incurs causalities.

Trading completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity often means trading hard decisions and balanced outcomes for easy decisions and predictable carnage.  "It depends" is often correct, but never pleasant to hear.  But the comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, so easily becomes the surest sign of truth, and therefore virtue.  Programmers will reduce rightness to Turing-esque, deductive, boolean reasoning---freedom or no freedom---because we select for the story that pleases us most, not the one that pleases those on the receiving end.

Until you cross the line from open source taker to open source maker.  Until you realize you'll be subject to the decisions of others more often than they'll be subject to yours.  Until you face your dependence and your interdependence, master of computing though you otherwise may be.

## Revolution, Reacting

> Rules which prevent you from taking matters ... into your own hands are too ridiculous to even consider abiding by.  ... When [the Tech Model Railroad Club] needed a set of diodes, or some extra relays, to build some new feature into The System, a few S&P people would wait until dark and find their way into the places where those things were kept.  None of the hackers, who were as a rule scrupulously honest in other matters, seemed to equate this with "stealing."  A willful blindness.
>
> --- Steven Levy, _Hackers_

Those who feel victimized by others go readily all-in on the values---liberty, care, fairness, and so on---denied to them.  That exclusive focus implicitly denies that other values protect anyone but victimizers and their cronies.  In time, after much doubling down, that denial becomes explicit.

Often the process manifests as vilification of a single, identifiable font of all affront, be it government, business, "godless communism", or "late capitalism".  The variously aggrieved may unite not around the particular values they expound, but the symbolic villains they blame.

All these mindsets come from life, and all the lessons informing them come from experience.  But extremism is ugly in all its forms.  No-common-denominator specialization in values yields an unworkable politics of reciprocal, exhibitionist shouting, cathartic until the other tribe yells back, shattering the fantasy of decisive, total domination.  Meanwhile, all that warfare easily drowns out any holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated seekers drawing no sharp good-versus-evil lines, who require far more sensitive deliberation but incur far less collateral damage.  Nuance hasn't any place in the cycle.

Software freedom obsession naturally results from software freedom impingement.  With the right (or wrong) reinforcement, it can readily outstrip its original stimulus.  Vilification of a symbol---IBM, Oracle, industry generally---naturally follows.

That doesn't making the obsessed or the vilifying fools.  Not by any means.  But intuitions shift.  Without deep social discourse and time, intellect can only mollify those instincts.  Those conditioned to bristle at "no" for an answer to any question about software will bristle, whether they reason themselves down from there or not.

We have heard a lot of shouting wars in free and open software.  Having another tribe to yell at has been essential for both.  Making tribes _within_ the culture online proved far more self-sufficient and self-satisfying than taking on industry through traditional media.  But all that shouting has largely drowned out those attempting to bring moralities and ideologies from without software within it.

Software wanted its ego stroked with a higher sense of purpose.  As it turns out, the easiest way for software to get its ego stroke was to do its own stroking.  A sense of higher purpose was easy when software philosophy exalted every release under the right form license, with no expectation of or mechanism for accountable end-user feedback, as a charitable or revolutionary act.  But as a greater number of programmers ventured outside and reported back on the unintentional, negative effects of software on society, that satisfaction got harder and harder to defend, leaving those without outside connections at a loss for greater purpose.

This phenomenon was not contained to theory and politics.

## Itches, Scratching

> "This is it ... this is where I belong..."  I know everyone here ... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again ... I know you all ...
>
> --- Loyd "The Mentor" Blankenship, [_The Conscience of a Hacker_](http://www.phrack.org/issues/7/3.html#article), 1986

> Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
>
> --- Eric Raymond, [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html), 1992

Writing software for yourself bypasses all the hardest parts of software development and design.  That can and does produce good software, but at a terrible price: reinforcing the programmer's personal isolation and the insularity of programming overall.

Developing development tools for other developers produces a pretty nice toolkit.  But it flexes none of the necessary muscles for wielding those tools against the really hard problems facing programming: understanding people who can't program computers and meeting their needs.

Eliciting requirements and feedback isn't necessary when the requirements and feedback are your own.  Accountability happens involuntarily.  So communication atrophies to the acerbic, confrontational engineering tone software is so known for.

Ensuring your work actually addresses a significant user need happens ipso facto when you satisfy yourself.  So a thousand web frameworks bloomed while encryption remained impractical for the average Jane or Joe.

Learning and leveraging new platforms, venues, and communication styles doesn't happen when you pick your platform, venue, and communication style of first choice over and over again.  GitHub hasn't taken off as a general-purpose collaboration tool outside software, and the more software-specific features it piles, the more it feels niched.

Historically, the prerequisites for programming addiction correlated tightly with a number of specific social and demographic factors.  So communing with others addicted to programming often means communing with others very similar in other ways.  The result is a culture riding the edge of monoculture.  Monocultures are often highly productive ... until they're utterly compromised.

## Conspiracy, Identifying

There's nothing inherently wrong with itch scratching projects, with projects whose users happen to be programmers, or with projects under permissive licenses doing wholly indeterminate good.  But there is less individually good about them than we've given ourselves credit for, and cause for concern about their effects in the aggregate.  When we understand how our individual works aggregate, we become responsible for our contributions to the effect overall.

One of those effects has been a large, growing, and increasingly formalized inequality between programmers and non-programmers.  Software developers expect, even loudly demand, that tools to their taste be free, and not just as in freedom.  As a group, they pillory peers who dare to undermine that norm with requests for payment or even lower-friction surrogates, like ads.  In other words, developers abhor in the developer-software market what they routinely demand in the market for software for everyone else.  Collegiality in the guild, commerce in the market.

We see similar patterns in terms besides compensation.  Copyleft is begrudgingly tolerated, politically if not operationally, in open software at large.  Until it threatens to cross the community-industry barrier.  Popular projects under once-strong copyleft terms, such as Linux and GCC, come with specially drafted legal exceptions designed to exempt applications built with from sharing alike.  Licenses beefing up copyleft to cover the primary use cases of dev tools aren't receive a heretic's welcome.

These phenomenon aren't lost on outside commentators.

As Adam Smith famously wrote:

> People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.

If he'd mentioned lowering costs or raising margins, and not just raising prices, he'd have covered open source and the software industry, as most software users see it today.  Whether individuals _intend_ to conspire, the effect is the same.  Lots of open collaboration among coders, but no such welcome for anyone else.  Lots of free software that coders can use, but not much software for others without big strings attached.

## Service, Inviting

> --- Green Day, ["Longview"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42BBdzzgPNM), 1994

The opposite of conspiracy is service.  The antidote to anomie is connection.  If you feel isolated, reach out.  If you're ready to serve, rather than lecture or preach, you'll be welcomed by the kind of people you want to work with.  Computer programmers are, after all, pretty useful.

Hackers seeking a richer kind of collaboration, respect for their role as accomplished specialist, reassurance about the good use and effect of their work, and a higher sense of purpose would do well to include users who _aren't_ programmers in their day-to-day, as deeply and as often as possible.  They'd do well to seek out frameworks for justification, meaning, and purpose in their work that range much more broadly than software.  And they'd do well by their peers to encourage the same.

Serving others who _don't_ share your expertise, culture, or lifestyle represents a distinct and important skill.  It's harder than naming things, and must be practiced.  It is not just requirements, user stories, focus groups, and testing.  It is far more than those things, and more than all of them combined.

To develop new skill and strength, follow the usual program.  Reorder your priorities, and flow them down into how you use your time.  Strong swimmers clock a lot of fast laps.  Good negotiators close a lot of tough deals.  Good grief counselors listen through a lot of pain.  Coders who work well with others work a lot of projects with others.

The difficulty of those skills makes them valuable.  Getting started takes discipline. But once the virtuous loop of struggle, success, and noticeable progress closes, practice becomes play, discipline becomes avocation, and you find yourself getting really, really good at something.  Something that others can value.  Something that can connect you to richer veins of purpose.

## Program, Proposing

My thrust here is general, but it's easy to make concrete.  Here is my personal plan.

_Prestige_:  I have consciously reordered my hierarchy of cool.  Kernels, compilers, languages, and dev tools are now longer the projects I admire most.  They are merely the kinds of projects I understand best.  The less the need met is a need I think the programmer related to before starting the project, the more I admire the programmer.

_Projects_:  I have begun to prioritize programming projects that serve non-programmers' needs, rather than my own.  Especially when I can be in close communication with the person or group of people hoping to use the application, from conception through deployment and maintenance.  I seek the closest working relationships I can get.

_Pairs_:  In programmer-to-programmer work, I am learning to see fellow programmers much as a I see fellow lawyers: as powerful but fundamentally incomplete halves, waiting for clients.  I am asking fellow programmers who they're working for, and to introduce the users they serve.  I am asking my users introduce me, rather than to introduce myself and mention them, whenever possible, and to keep them involved in discussions directly.

_Platforms_:  I am learning to prioritize _users_' choice of collaborative platforms and tools over programming-specific alternatives.  Discourse over GitHub.  SMS over IRC.  There are incredible unmet needs for collaboration tools general enough to accommodate users, coders, designers, and other specialists.  But unless and until they arrive, good coder-user collaboration is far more important than coder comfort.

_Praise_:  I am making a point to praise peers that I see actively and accountably practicing what I preach.  And I am learning to graciously accept compliments when I do so.  I strive to both be and to reinforce the kind of good software and the software-using world need so desperately need now.

## Dependence, Selecting

>  Freedom means having control over your own life.  If you use a program to carry out activities in your life, your freedom depends on your having control over the program.  You deserve to have control over the programs you use, and all the more so when you use them for something important in your life.
>
> --- Richard Stallman, [_Free Software is Even More Important Now_](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html)

Reading through the theorizations of free software and open source, it's easy to trace a missing thread:  Everybody was going to be a programmer.  Everybody was going to want to be.  After all, in the early days, there was no running programs without entering the sanctum of the computer lab.

Some professions have gone that way.  Scribes, for example.  But everyday life is littered with professions that haven't dissolved away into popular practice.  I hold out great hope that non-lawyers will do more of their own legal work, for example.  But I don't expect that everyone will, or that artificial intelligence will replace them.  I'm no doctor, dentist, priest, and so on, but I doubt they expect the same for their own specialties.  I haven't asked, but I don't think my barber, office janitor, or insurance agent nurse fear imminent obsolescence, either.  There are things in my life that I need and receive, but take no greater part in.

I am no less free for relying on others to live my life.  I am in a sense less independent.  But I revel in the choice of my dependencies and the connectedness they bring.  I'm grateful for the willingness and availability of others to take control over aspects of my life, and to steward them better than I would alone.  I'm grateful for the unprompted, often utterly unrelated conversations and interactions that having people do those things produces.

My life is richer for it.  All the care, the history, the wonkishness that I put into a license, a policy, or a contract for a client, I can see in the people and work that I rely on.  I can prattle on for hours about computer keyboards, copyleft, and contract law.  When I ask my dental hygienist about the Cavitron, or the x-ray software, or what "SLS" means in toothpaste, it's clear they've made a life in dentistry, and that there's a whole life to be made in there.  When I ask my barber about the differences between Korean, Vancouver, and American fashion, I get an earful, in English---an extra effort for a Vietnamese boat person.

I'm tempted to preach openness to these people as I know it.  There is something to that:  They may not have considered rowing that directly upstream of the rules and regulations of their work.  It's not an obvious tactic.

But most have showed me every kind of openness that I have ever asked for.  They gladly answer questions of nearly any kind, including questions that allow me to do more for myself, without them.  Their willingness to answer my questions is tempered, if at all, by concern that I'll take undue risks with a novice hand, complicating their assumptions or plan to serve me well, and concern for the responsibility they'll bear for choices not entirely their own.  But is just because of the trust their answers builds that I usually choose not deepen, rather than deviate from, our relationship.

It's the same with my law clients today.  Every opportunity to show my work is not a relationship at risk, but a chance to deepen that relationship.  It was the same with my software clients, in a past life.  Nothing says confidence like enthusiasm for a question where they might have seen defensive maneuvers.

Software was born a [monastic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monastic_order&redirect=no).
