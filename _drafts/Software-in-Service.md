Open software feels stuck in a hole because it has dug itself into a hole.  High on a heady mix of compulsion, self-sufficiency, and detachment, software has set itself off from the broader world socially, intellectually, and practically.  It has turned inward on itself for all apparent needs, and predictably come up short of nearly everything but code.  It has come up short of meaning.

Scratching our own itches keeps us alone.  Stroking our own egos keeps us alone.  Fetishizing autonomy and self-reference keeps us alone.  The combination has made software---free, open, and closed---an exemplary conspiracy against the laity.  And the laity is pissed.

With a little outside perspective, the problem is obvious, and so are the solutions.  Meet others and scratch their itches.  Take your standards of self-actualization from outside software.  Open yourself, not your software.  In short, the antidote to conspiracy is service.  Service that takes coders out of software land.  That can and will change software.

The question is isn't what to do, but whether software can get out more, stop lecturing the rest of society when it does, and learn the discipline it needs to reintegrate into the world, rather than further secede from it.  But who wants discipline when they can't see a problem?

## Simplicity, Suspecting

> While we can distinguish various nonfree distribution schemes in terms of how far they fall short of being free, we consider them all equally unethical.

> --- Richard Stallman, [_What is Free Software?_](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) as of [November 21, 2013](https://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/www/www/philosophy/free-sw.html?revision=1.125&view=markup)

> When asking the question "When is it wrong (or right) to use closed-source software?", we should treat it the same way we treat every other ethical question.  First, by being very clear about what harmful consequences we wish to avoid; second, by reasoning from the avoidance of harm to a rule that is minimal and restricts peoples' choices as little as possible.

> --- Eric Raymond, [_Evaluating the Harm from Closed Source_](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4371)

Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.  When someone promises to make ethics simple, experience should make us skeptical.  The guru may be gaining more from the title than they contribute to right living, or even good theory.

That has been free and open source software ideology in my lifetime.  Its proponents donned ethical, philosophical, economic, even religious vestments from early on.  But both honest analysis and common experience lay those pretensions bare.

Pervasive free and open source ideology oversimplifies hard ethical problems by reducing them to a single domain, software, and a single variable, freedom, hence "software freedom".  We're all born free to compute as we please.  Neither computer programmers nor computer companies deserve to impinge.  If they uniformly didn't, life would be swell.

Almost no one's real-world morality boils down to "Can folks do what they wanna?"  What's right just isn't so black-and-white.  Almost no one's real-world experience exalts mankind as saints sadly constrained by circumstance.  People just aren't so simple.  Almost no one's real-world politics boils down to "Do folks have an absolute right to _X_?", where _X_ is speech, assembly, religion, guns, contract, conscience, or the like.  Justice just isn't so straightforward.

## Appeal, Explaining

> If you think moral reasoning is something we do to figure out the truth, you'll be constantly frustrated by how foolish, biased, and illogical people become when they disagree with you.  But if you think about moral reasoning as a skill we humans evolved to further our social agendas---to justify our own actions and to defend the teams we belong to---then things will make a lot more sense.  Keep your eye on the intuitions, and don't take people's moral arguments at face value.  They are mostly post hoc constructions made up on the fly, crafted to advance one or more strategic objectives.
>
> --- Jonathan Haidt, _The Righteous Mind_

I personally accepted delusions of ethical grandeur and loose use of weighty words like "philosophy" because they imbued my personal choices about software, well within my control, even in childhood, with outsize meaning and importance.  They enabled me to believe that my use of a copyright license, or even my taste in other peoples' software, amounted to countercultural, charitable, even revolutionary acts.

They did not.  Except in the view of others similarly seduced to self-exaltation.

A glancing comparison to nearly any other source of moral teaching available to me would have revealed how simplistic that line of thinking was.  Moral philosophy remains messy, frustrating, and humbling, like engineering, medicine, social work, and any other discipline accountable to the muck and mire of reality.  Moral codes come riddled with exceptions, littered with factors to weigh and balance.  Software freedom asks little, delivers clarity, feels great, and promises empowerment.  It boils down to one long boolean `AND` predicate:  Do you have all the freedoms on the list?

Too good to be true is easy to spot, unless it's too good for _you_.  Then it's damn near impossible.  Software freedom was very good to me.  It _felt_ better, even though it was worse.  But I wasn't accountable to anyone, except to myself, so feelings won out.  Until the reality checks came.

## Horribles, Parading

I care for those near to me.  I value loyalty, respect, and fairness.  I cherish connections to higher meanings and purposes.  And yes, I enjoy my liberty.  But I seek a balance of those concerns and personal liberty when they conflict, as they often do.  As more people and companies get involved in open source, values conflicts are getting harder to miss.

The path to this realization is well trodden, and increasingly well observed.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom stoke disregard, devaluation, and abuse of people who make software.  I've seen developers browbeaten into slapping licenses on their work not for their own benefit, or for any concrete greater good, but for the benefit of those beating brow.  I've seen bug reports demanding features and fixes gush entitlement … and nary a drop of gratitude.

All of that is profoundly mean.  Blindly maximizing software freedom, privileging one set of people over another because we deem them "users", compromises basic human care.  Nobody wants to join a movement that fills their life with abuse.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom birth successive generations of dominant firms---O'Reilly, Red Hat, Amazon---adept at reaping the value of projects they did not sow.  I've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with growing projects, only to be outdone by runaway incumbents wherever they turned for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  I've seen those firms work, consciously and by competitive pressure, to trumpet the freedoms that play to their advantages, elide the freedoms that level the field, and guide the meaning of "free" and "open" to like effect.

All of that is profoundly unfair.  Blindly maximizing software freedom, and gaming what freedom means, compromises essential fairness.  Nobody wants to play a game stacked against them.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable powerful user-come-latelys to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. I've seen burned out developers replaced by fresh blood waiting in the wings, projects marginalized and threatened with hostile forks from consortia of household names, and new ideas eclipsed by clones from hirelings making bank while the original developers flailed.  I've seen the norm of credit for developers behind projects fall from expected condition to broadly ignored chore to "proprietary" mortal sin.

All of this is profoundly disrespectful and often intimately disloyal.  Blindly maximizing freedom compromises respect and authority.  Nobody wants to join a community as disposable human sacrifice.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable takers to turn makers' work against the very things that inspired them in the first place.  I've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into surveillance, and cryptosystems into boiler-room scams.  I've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using share-alike tools without a single new line of free source code to show for it.

All of this saps developers' sense of nobility in work.  Blindly maximizing freedoms compromises purpose.  Nobody wants to do free labor for the baddies, or to pour their life's effort into a thankless void.

All of this is the interdependence of values in action.  When the only value we measure is freedom, freedom expands to fill all available space, choking loyalty, respect, fairness, purpose, and even basic human decency.  That is what happens when a system places any single value above all others.  Free and open praxis at scale demonstrates the costs of that absolutism just as clearly as its benefits.

## Egos, Stroking

> The whole history of computers is rampant with cheerleading at best and bigotry at worst.
>
> --- Larry Wall

I don't parade these horribles to paint a one-sided picture of free or open source software.  I've written at length on how "open" writ large has improved my life and the lives of others.  It still does.

Well worn narratives extol the benefits of free and open source software.  Those narratives rose to the top in part by eliding or downplaying all mention of the costs.  So we're left to recount those costs anecdotally, unsystematically, however common our experience of them may be.

Putting both costs and benefits on a flat playing field presents a stark choice:  Do we write off the costs for the benefits?  Do we ignore the benefits in light of the costs?  Or do we try to weigh and balance?  If we weigh and balance, how?  Who will benefit by our decision?

When software-freedom absolutism indirectly facilitates a good outcome in any other dimension, true believers happily credit their cause.  Given absolute freedom, they tell us to expect good to follow.  But when software freedom takes a toll, the faithful blame the victim or write them off as collateral damage.  You shouldn't have done open source ... like we told you to.  You didn't do it open enough ... my way.  You didn't do it for the right reasons ... my reasons.  You didn't use the right tools ... my tools.

At one point or another, I've brandished all these too-convenient criticisms.

Just as computer programming reduces complex problems down to computable approximations, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside it to grab glittering generalities like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a bad approximation of life.  Just as software reductionism looses well-intentioned, predictably malign systems on the world, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinkered or indifferent to predictable consequences.  When good theory starts from bad assumptions, applying that theory on the world, or forcing the world to fit it, incurs causalities.

Trading completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity often means trading hard decisions and balanced outcomes for easy decisions and predictable carnage.  "It depends" is often correct, but never pleasant to hear.  But the comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, so easily becomes the surest sign of truth, and therefore virtue.  Rightness _must_ be reduced to Turing-esque, deductive, boolean reasoning---freedom or no freedom---because we select for the doctrine that pleases us---the ones computing the moral answers---and not those subjected to our conclusions.

Until you cross the line from open source taker to open source maker.  Until you realize you'll be subject to the decisions of others more often than they'll be subject to yours.  Until you face your dependence and your interdependence, master of computing though you otherwise may be.

## Revolution, Reacting

Those who feel victimized by others go readily all-in on the values---liberty, care, fairness, and so on---denied to them.  That exclusive focus implicitly denies that other values protect anyone but victimizers and their cronies.  In time, after much doubling down, that denial becomes explicit.

Often the process manifests as vilification of a single, identifiable font of all affront, be it government, business, "godless communism", or "late capitalism".  The variously aggrieved may unite not around the particular values they expound, but the symbolic villains they blame.

All these mindsets come from life, and all the lessons informing them come from experience.  But extremism is ugly in all its forms.  No-common-denominator specialization in values yields an unworkable politics of reciprocal, exhibitionist shouting, cathartic until the other tribe yells back, shattering the fantasy of decisive, total domination.  Meanwhile, all that shouting energy easily drowns out any holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated seekers drawing no sharp good-versus-evil lines, who require far more sensitive deliberation but incur far less collateral damage.  Nuance hasn't any place in the cycle.

Software freedom obsession naturally results from software freedom impingement.  With the right (or wrong) reinforcement, it can readily oustrip its original stimulus.  Vilification of a symbol---IBM, Oracle, industry generally---naturally follows.

That doesn't making the obsessed or the vilifying fools.  Not by any means.  But intuitions shift.  Without deep social discourse and time, intellect can only mollify those instincts.  Those conditioned to bristle at "no" for an answer to any question about software will bristle, whether they reason themselves down from there or not.

We have heard a lot of value shouting in free and open software.  Having another tribe to yell at has been essential for both.  Making tribes _within_ the culture online proved far more self-sufficient and self-satisfying than taking on industry through traditional media.  But all that shouting has largely drowned out those attempting to bring moralities and ideologies from without software within it.

Software wanted its ego stroked with a higher sense of purpose.  As it turns out, the easiest way for software to get its ego stroke was to stroke it for itself.  A sense of higher purpose was easy when software philosophy exalted every release under the right form license, with no expectation of or mechanism for accountable end-user feedback, as a charitable or revolutionary act.  But as a greater and greater number of programmers venture outside and report back on the unintentional, negative effects of software on society, that satisfaction gets harder and harder to defend, leaving those without outside connections at a loss for greater purpose.

It's not hard to find evidence for this pattern.  And not just in theory and politics.

## Itches, Scratching

> --- Eric Raymond, [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html), 1992

Writing software for yourself short-circuits all the hardest parts of software development.  That can and does produce good software, but at a terrible price: reinforcing the programmer's personal isolation and the insularity of programming overall.

Developing development tools for other developers produces a pretty nice toolkit.  But it flexes none of the necessary muscles for wielding those tools against the really hard problems facing programming: understanding people who can't program computers and meeting needs.

Eliciting requirements and feedback isn't necessary when the requirements and feedback are your own.  Accountability happens involuntarily.  So communication atrophies to the acerbic, confrontational engineering tone software is so known for.

Ensuring your work actually addresses a significant user need happens ipso facto when you satisfy yourself.  So a thousand web frameworks bloomed while encryption remained impractical for the average Jane or Joe.

Learning and leveraging new platforms, venues, and communication styles doesn't tend to happen when you pick your first-choice platforms, venues, and communication styles over and over again.  GitHub hasn't taken off as a general-purpose collaboration tool outside software, and the more software-specific features it piles, the less hope I hold out.

Historically, the prerequisites for programming addiction correlated tightly with a number of social and demographic factors.  Communing with others addicted to programming often means communing with others very similar.  The result is a culture riding the edge of monoculture.

## Threads, Connecting

There's nothing inherently wrong with itch scratching projects, with projects whose users happen to be programmers, or with projects under permissive licenses doing wholly indeterminate good.  But there is less inherently good about them than we've given ourselves credit for.

Developer tools, libraries, frameworks, and other tools of the trade can and will fall out of good work for non-programmer needs.  But going about things backwards---inside work before outside work---and valuing things also backwards---self service and peer service over public service---have systematically closed programming off from the world, made its culture insular.  Which in turn has alienated society from the software it relies on.

As Adam Smith famously wrote:

> People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.

If he'd mentioned lowering costs or raising margins, and not just raising prices, he'd have covered open source and the software industry, as most software users see it today.  Lots of open collaboration among coders, but not much sign of welcome for anyone else.  Lots of free software that coders can use, but not much software for non-coders without strings attached.

## Service, Inviting

> When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely.
>
> --- Green Day, "Longview", 1994

The opposite of conspiracy is service.  The antidote to anomie is connection.  If you feel isolated, reach out.  If you're ready to serve, rather than lecture or preach, you'll be welcomed by the kind of people you want to work with.

Hackers seeking a richer kind of collaboration, respect for their role as accomplished specialist, reassurance about the good use and effect of their work, and a higher sense of purpose would do well to include users who _aren't_ programmers in their day-to-day, as deeply and as often as possible.  They'd do well to seek out frameworks for justification, meaning, and purpose in their work that range much more broadly than software.  And they'd do well by their peers to encourage the same.

Serving others who _don't_ share your expertise, culture, or lifestyle represents a distinct and important skill.  It's harder than naming things, and must be practiced.  It is not just requirements, user stories, focus groups, and testing.  It is far more than those things, and more than all of them combined.

To develop new skill and strength, follow the usual program.  Reorder your personal priorities, then allow the use of your time to change.  A strong swimmer clocks a lot of fast laps.  A good negotiator closes a lot of tough deals.  A good grief counselor listens through a lot of pain.

The difficulty of those skills makes them valuable.  Getting started takes discipline. But once the virtuous loop of struggle, success, and compelling progress closes, practice becomes play, discipline becomes avocation, and you find yourself getting really, really good at something.  Something that others can value.

As a simple starting point, consider the "buddy system":

1. Prioritize programming projects that serve non-programmers' needs, rather than your own.  Especially when you can be in close communication with the person or group of people hoping to use your work from conception through deployment and maintenance.  Build the closest working relationships you can.

2. For projects you maintain, ask contributors and would-be contributors who they're working with, and bring them into discussions as directly as possible.  Better yet, ask users to introduce their developers into your project.  Either way, establish a norm of seeing programmers like agents, doctors, lawyers, or other professionals---incomplete halves of potentially powerful pairs.  Pick your tools and platform accordingly.  Make users welcome first.

3. Make a point to praise peers you see actively and accountably serving others outside of software with their work.  Graciously accept compliments for your own service.  Do good work, and you'll deserve the praise.  Programming as a whole deserves the reinforcement.

## Dependence, Selecting

>  Freedom means having control over your own life.  If you use a program to carry out activities in your life, your freedom depends on your having control over the program.  You deserve to have control over the programs you use, and all the more so when you use them for something important in your life.
>
> --- Richard Stallman, [_Free Software is Even More Important Now_](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html)

Reading through the post hoc rationalizations of free software and open source, it's easy to trace a long-running thread: Everybody was going to be a programmer.  Everybody was going to want to be.

Some professions have gone that way.  Scribes, for example.  But everyday life is littered with professions that didn't.  I hold out great hope that non-lawyers will do more of their own legal work.  But I don't expect that everyone will, or that artificial intelligence will replace me.  I'm no doctor, dentist, priest, and so on, but I doubt they expect the same for their own specialties.  I haven't asked, but I don't think my barber, office janitor, or motorcycle mechanic mentor hold out similar hopes.

I am no less free for relying on those people to live my life.  I am in a sense less independent.  But I revel in the choice of my own dependencies and the connectedness they bring.  I'm grateful for the willingness and availability of others to take control over so many aspects of my life, to steward them better than I would.

My life is richer for it.  All the care, the history, the wonkishness that I put into a license, a policy, or a contract for a client, I can see in the people and work that I rely on.  I can prattle on for hours about computer keyboards, copyleft, and contract law.  When I ask my dental hygienist about the Cavitron, or the x-ray software, or what "SLS" means in toothpaste, it's clear they've made a life in dentistry, and there's a whole life to be made in there.  When I ask my barber about the differences between Korean, Vancouver, and American styles, and whether that has anything to do with all the catholic clergy coming to see him, I get an earful, in English---an extra effort for a Vietnamese boat person.

I'm tempted to preach openness to these people as I know it.  There is something to that:  They may not have considered rowing that directly upstream of the rules and regulations of their work.  It's not an obvious tactic.  But they have showed me every kind of openness more generally speaking that I have ever asked for.  They gladly answer questions of nearly kind, including questions that allow me to do more for myself, without them.  Their willingness is tempered, if at all, by concern that I'll take undue risks with a novice hand, complicate their assumptions about how to serve me well, and the responsibility they'll bear for choices not entirely their own.  Even if I never intend to take over, I choose those I depend on in large part by their openness to my curiosity.  I expect clients of my law practice to choose and become comfortable with me at least in part by the same token.

> --- _The Hacker Manifesto_

Early software companies' secrecy and restrictions threatened hackers' freedom, empowerment, and reverence for the new interactive computing machines.  So the truest believers launched a counterattack, first as free software, now best known as open source.  That movement claims victory today.  But the widespread use of its methods---open licenses, methodologies, governance, platforms, and tools---by the same sorts of companies they were designed to resist again threatens hackers' ability to frame their hacking as contribution to a better world.

A new generation of programming addicts is turning away from the figureheads, foundations, firms, and faith tenets of free and open source.  Where are they going?

Some aim to reform open source pragmatics, hoping an even opener open source will cure its own ills.  Some seek to revive free software ethics out of reverence for its idealized, precommercial form.  But the lived experience of taking new ideas back to any storied old school hasn't been free-flowing collaboration, but brusque rejection and swift social condemnation.  The thick moral, technical, and political language slathered on to justify and edify free open and open development in retrospect doesn't apply prospectively to anything that might fork the game, rather than simply improve it.  The moral, technical, and political justifications "worked".  Those served by their success now see them as desirably stable dependencies, not levers of change.

They were never levers of change.  Change came first.  The tools, licenses, and conventions long preceded the definitions, essays, and institutions.

The lived experience of that realization teaches that open-source ideology, free-software morality, and the conflicts between them were never the question or any answer.  That's category error.  Making source open doesn't inevitably make it better.  Making software free doesn't make `git push` a virtuous act.  But believing so justifies and aggrandizes what developers want to do anyway: sling code with their fellow obsessed.  Justifying the means _is_ the end.

We want to feel good about software we use, software we make, how we make it, and who we make it with.  We need morality to tell us we're good, philosophy to tell us we matter, and ideology to tell us we're right about ourselves.  But good morality, philosophy, and ideology don't come from within software.  Good morality, philosophy, and ideology aren't hobby- or industry-specific.

Only the tools, techniques, and organizations of software stand on their own.  The tools, techniques, and organizations of free and open source software aren't going anywhere.  But they are only that.  Free isn't going to win out over open.  Open may be closer to winning out over free.  But this or that flavor of retroactive continuity won't change the rest of the plot.

The next great leaps in method, inspiration, and productivity will build on free and open tools, techniques, and organizations as prior art.  They won't build on their ideologies, or fit on the old free-open line.  New motivations will create and validate them.  New narratives will justify their success.

## Prologue

Software was born a [monastic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Monastic_order&redirect=no).  It fashioned itself a [missionary order](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Missionary_order&redirect=no).  It is time to meet the world as a [mendicant order](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mendicant_order&redirect=no).
