Open source is great if you are, want to be, or want to work for, a large corporation.  Even then, your chances aren't great.  Open source rarely turns bad hands into good ones.

The overwhelming majority of open source software projects fail.  Among the very small fraction that succeed, the overwhelming majority again do so without broad-based contribution or financial support.  The norm is a single active developer with little or no help.

In other words, success, contribution, and support in open source follow vicious power laws.  A few get a lot, the rest little or nothing.  And between those steep inequalities we see the Matthew Principle.  Those who have more get more, and more of the rest.  Those who don't lose out.

Take a cold, hard, rigorous look at the numbers, this is what you will find.  And there's nothing inherently wrong with it, just as there's nothing inherently wrong with steep odds for new startups, rock bands, or artists.  But alas, attention, and therefore preception, follows the power law and the Matthew Principle, too.  The slim fraction of a slim fraction of a slim fraction of successful open source projects that attract broad-based contribution and support get nearly all the publicity and mindshare.  Which projects come to mind first when explaining open source?  Linux.  Apache.  Wikipedia.  Winners of the late 1990s and early 2000s, yet to be overthrown in our mental pantheons.

More recently, we might add some newer stalwarts.  But those are predominantly corporate-sponsored projects, like Kubernetes and Tensorflow, for which the sponsors spend lavishly on marketing and lend the full weight and power of their existing, household names.  When Google decides to rebrand as a cloud and AI company, then throws that brand behind free projects, contribution, funding, and verve fall off for anything else.  The attention that once bespoke deep bottom-up success can be purchased, top down, along with able strategists who see things clearly and work to ensure the privileges of the chosen-few status flow back.

Depending on how and why you got into open source, seeing multinational corporations deftly deploy its methods and name rec as mere tactics in boader strategic plans represents either rock-bottom of the fall from antiestablishment ruckus to MBA pablum, on the one hand, or the full and final realization of an intentional drive to preselytize up to the tallest titans of industry.  Either way, unless it's truly all about the money, and you got your stock twenty years ago, or a new batch of RSUs coming tomorrow, there's not much dashing sex appeal left in the matter.

Open source is a work thing.  We use it to distort markets and commodify competitors.  We use it to kick off new lines of business and enhance recruiting.  We do a ton of it, as much as we can, in our free times or pre-graudate phases, in hopes that [FANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech)-senpai will notice us.

The forever flame we keep with us through it all is called "software freedom", "openness" writ large, or merely some nameless, wordless notion that the open way is good, right, just, better, and progressive.  That it is inherently splendid and the highest path.
