title: Pay the Fiddler
description: an old line from days of yore
---

> Is is an old maxim and a very sound one, that he that dances should always pay the fiddler.  Now, sir, in the present case, if any gentlemen, whose money is a burden to them, choose to lead off a dance, I am decidedly opposed to the people's money being used to pay the fiddler.
