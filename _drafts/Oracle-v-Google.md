You don't have to be an intellectual property hawk or a clueless technophobe to feel queasy about _Oracle v. Google_.

I grew up programming, reading [Larry Lessig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Lessig), and running Linux.  Now I'm a lawyer.  I advise a lot on "open" in various forms.  I've read the Supreme Court opinions several times.  If anything, the universal industry-side acclaim for the decision---at least through the feeds I scroll---only deepens my unease since the opinions hit [supremecourt.gov](https://supremecourt.gov).

On the industry side, I'm not so sure this was a good result.

On the legal side, I'm pretty sure it was a bad decision.

## Ugh

It's dangerous to declare the current state of broad coverage on any issue biased, then set out to restore balance to the universe single-handedly.  That usually leads to something even more bent than anything you started by complaining about, just bent in the other direction.  Inevitably, someone will read just your take, or take just your take seriously, and become a monster.

Frankly, though, I think the cost of incompleteness outweighs the risk of overstatement.  Apart from Clarence Thomas' dissent, which I'm not the slightest bit interested in gushing over like a fanboy, I've seen some knee-jerk, copyright maximalist takes, and not much more.

I'll bite.

## Preliminaries

The lawyers definitely won this case, after fifteen years and gobs of billable hours.  Google also won, if you don't think too much about the lawyers.  It's less clear who else this decision will be good for, or why.  Especially if you look beyond threatened disruption---remember that word?---to the Android flow of payments.

As for the specifics, a lot of the headlines and comment-section summaries get the decision wrong.  The Supreme Court didn't say application programming interfaces can't be copyrighted.  It _assumed they can_, and let an earlier appeals court decision saying as much stand.  Instead, six out of eight justices hearing the case agreed that "fair use", one of the "defenses" that can let you off if you commit copyright infringement, lets Android off for copying Java APIs and writing their own implementations.

## Fair Use

[Fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) at the Supreme Court level is basically [Calvinball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes#Calvinball).  Unless the rest of the government comes along and rewrites [the fair use section of the Copyright Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2019-title17/USCODE-2019-title17-chap1-sec107), which was mostly just Congress trying to write out what courts were already doing in the first place, the Supreme Court makes the rules about what is and isn't fair use up as it goes along.  The big court doesn't _have_ to hear any particular case about fair use.  So when it does, "fair use" usually means something different coming out than it did going in.

The Supreme Court doesn't take that many fair use cases.  That partly explains the problem with fair use.  We can calk the balance up to the form that fair use takes, as a rule.  Fair use represents, maybe even epitomizes, the least code-like kind of law we have.  Known as a ["factor test" or "balancing test"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balancing_test), fair use isn't a bunch of if-then kinds of statements, which lawyers call ["bright line rules"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright-line_rule), but a crib sheet of "factors", or prompts, that courts are supposed to remember to think about, toss into the pot, season with magisterial judgment, and [stir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AER7cAiN4g0).

Lower court judges are supposed to watch how higher-ups do it, then follow along, under supervision.  Again, this is tough, since the Supreme Court doesn't do many fair uses cases.  When the two sides fighting a copyright war have the time and money to keep going to trial and filing appeals, as they rarely do, we see case histories like _Oracle v. Google_, where perfectly competent judges, up and down the hierarchy, completely disagree with each other.

For people who aren't federal judges, this makes fair use mysterious to behold and slippery to stand on.  Especially outside situations that have already come up lots of times in relatively established media, like book reviews quoting novels, or in industries where repeat players and specialists establish their own rules over time, [like film and TV, where insurance companies write policies to cover copyright lawsuits](https://www.amazon.com/Clearance-Copyright-4th-Everything-Television/dp/1935247123).  Even in cases that seem to point strongly one way or the other, the open-endedness of fair use makes fair litigation rather open-ended, too.  That means even higher court costs, attorneys' fees, and time delays that very few can pay.  It takes a real battle of titans, like Oracle and Google, with a big prize at stake, like royalties on Android installs, to make new law on these things.  Any case like this is kind of a fluke.

For people who _are_ federal judges, all this bad news is good news.  Esoteric wishy-wash---"flexible" factor test, "case-by-case" analysis, judicious "balancing"---means that much more of a free hand to do what you want, rather than whatever Congress told you to do, by statute.  Especially at the Supreme Court, that free hand extends to making broad public policy, as opposed to only law, or even opposed to the law.  That's arguably what's happened here: Congress said that software comes under copyright, but the Supreme Court seems to want to say that software APIs do not.

Comparing fair use rules and copyrightability rules shows a lot.  Copyrightability rules _do_ tend to take if-then form, and many of those forms are spelled out right in the Copyright Act that Congress wrote.  Even some of the vaguer concepts referenced in those rules, like the requirement that copyrightable work be "creative", have developed toward predictability over time.  Lawyers can't say exactly what the threshold for minimum creativity is, in if-then terms.  But we know it's really, really low.  If a person did the creating, rather than, say, a machine or a [monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute), it's probably copyrightable.  So apart from fun, quirky cases that make the legal blogs, it's not a common practical issue that creators or users get hung up on in practice.

I can't help coming away from the Supreme Court's written opinion thinking that at least some justices wanted to say APIs can't be copyrighted, but didn't think they could rationalize that as interpreting the Copyright Law Congress passed, rather than making up policy on their own.  So they looked to the part of Copyright Act where Congress basically gave them some hints and told them to keep working it out—fair use—and routed the question that way, so they could reach the result they wanted.  Then they littered their opinion with all kinds of odd caveats that this decision is special and shouldn't really affect the rest of fair use.  Don't get any big ideas, lower-court judges!

Basically, the Supreme Court took copyright law to the rework station, [MacGyver'ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver) in an ugly bypass, doused it with alcohol, scrubbed away the flux, and potted the bodge in black goo, to keep its heretical emanations away from the rest of the circuit.  Or, if you prefer:

```diff
  def fair_use (work, use_case, context):
+   # Ignore this part and skip to old_fair_use.
+   # DO NOT TOUCH THIS CODE!
+   if work.declaring_code and use_case.androidish:
+     return true
+   else:
+     return old_fair_use(work, use_case)
+
+ def old_fair_use(work, use_case, context):
    # https://copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html
    # 17 U.S.C. 107
    # &c. &c. &c.
```

If this looks like a hack job, that's because it is.  If the result looks like a back door, that's because it is.

Thomas and Alito called their colleagues out on this, because that's what you do when you lose the vote at the meeting. Also because holding yourself out as doing just what Congress says, as opposed to what you want, is talking point one of conservative [judicial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism) [shtick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textualism).

The question now is that `if` statement.  Does the rule of this case apply to _all_ declaring code?  Just declaring code that lots of programmers have invested in learning?  Just declaring code in programming language standard libraries?  Just declaring code in Java's?  Does the rule apply to all uses of that declaring code?  Just uses in arguably novel computing platforms? Just Android or very Android-like things?

The folks who think copyright should last forever, crush all its enemies, see them driven before it, and hear the lamentation of their women are predictably pushing to frame this as a one-off, a fluke, a narrow exception.  The folks who consume more than they create and deduce form this that intellectual property affronts all laws of God and man have doubtless green-lit projects to yoink competitors' APIs with big smug grins on their faces.  Upshot?  Lawyers gonna get paid.  It's still fair use we're talking about here.

A couple for those lawyers, while they're waiting:

Name another _kind_ of work where copyright applies, but fair use makes that protection practically irrelevant.

Name another Supreme Court decision where the majority explicitly _assumes_ a prerequisite legal conclusion, then tries to leave the question of whether that conclusion is even legally possible open to debate.

## Bad Metaphors

After the lawyers argued this case at the Supreme Court, I [blogged a list of the many metaphors](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2020/10/12/Oracle-Google-Metaphors) bandied from podium and bench.  Competitive analogizing continued in the written opinions.

The majority lobbed a few, some of which we'd heard before.  An API is like a factory floor stocked with tools.  An API is like the gas pedal in a car.  An API is like the QWERTY keyboard layout on ... a typewriter.

Compare Clarence Thomas, in dissent:

> Like many programming languages, Java allows developers to prewrite small subprograms called "methods."  Methods form the building blocks of more complex programs. This process is not unlike what legislatures do with statutes.  To save space and time, legislatures define terms and then use those definitions as a shorthand. For example, the legal definition for "refugee" is more than 300 words long.  [8 U.S.C. § 1101](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2019-title8/USCODE-2019-title8-chap12-subchapI-sec1101)(42).  Rather than repeat all those words every time they are relevant, the U.S. Code encapsulates them all with a single term that it then inserts into each relevant section. Java methods work similarly.  Once a method has been defined, a developer need only type a few characters (the method name and relevant inputs) to invoke everything contained in the subprogram.  A programmer familiar with prewritten methods can string many of them together to quickly develop complicated programs without having to write from scratch all the basic subprograms.

As ill-disposed as I am to give it to him, this is the best metaphor in the record.  And it's well stated.

The quality of the imagery bears fruit.  Later, addressing programmer familiarity, Thomas continues:

> Many other copyrighted works depend on the same.  A Broadway musical script needs actors and singers to invest time learning and rehearsing it.  But a theater cannot copy a script---the rights to which are held by a smaller theater---simply because it wants to entice actors to switch theaters and because copying the script is more efficient than requiring the actors to learn a new one.

I'm no Clarence Thomas fan.  I'm no musical [theater aficionado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia), either.  But I have played a few parts on a few small stages, in a couple of languages.  I've learned a few programming languages, Java among them, back when Java was fresh and rad.  But I have to admit I think Thomas groks it.  I don't think Breyer does.

If I'm wrong, and Breyer was right there with Thomas, he picked some lousy metaphors.  Perhaps because they better square with the conclusion he reached, and that his colleagues joined.  But they don't square so well with my experience of software.  Or my education in how copyright applies to it.

## Dumbing it Down, Keeping it There

One explanation for the way the majority spun "declaring code" stems from the way those involved in the case chose to explain APIs to judges.  They chose to dumb it down, and never really built up from there.

The majority mentions `java.lang.Math.max`.  The dissent quotes a hypothetical implementation of a similar method in full:

```java
public static int MaxNum (int x, int y, int z) {
  if (x >= y && x >= z) return x;
  else if (y >= x && y >= z) return y;
  else return z;
}
```

The amicus brief of "83 computer scientists" focuses on `sort` for integers.  Probably to make room to talk about different algorithms.  Still very basic.

I see no clear sign in the opinions that the Supreme Court justices got beyond basic.

Certainly, some Java APIs represent rather rudimentary, low-level operations on elemental, unboxed types.  And there remain viable legal questions about whether some of those, like `max` of `a` and `b`, are derivative of prior work, or too rote or formulaic for copyright protection.

There are fewer such questions about higher-level and more innovative APIs.  APIs that deal with memory, with process management, with streams, with reflection.  The way that some APIs build on other APIs, not in implementation, but for types and other abstractions.  They way that aspects of the Java language proper flow through, and were creatively exposed by, core libraries.

`max` and `sort` are nice, hour-one, napkin-sketch introductions to Java and `java.lang`.  But stopping there leaves a woefully underdeveloped picture of what APIs are and do, not just in Java, but more generally.  There is very little of the complexity, abstraction, or creativity of API design in `max` and `sort`, apart from that which burbles up from the designs of the underlying real and virtual machines.  There is very little more than baseline, "thin", copyright-law-minimum creativity.  There is very little sense of what a pure ray of shining light the whole Java proposition, APIs very much included, represented, especially compared to the carbon-black, accretive cruft that prevailed before it in mainstream programming.

Some elements of Java were basic, and some were derivative.  Elements of any copyrighted work always are.  The question is whether there was also something more, deserving of economic protection for the creator.  There was.  The whole of Java, as offered, was workmanlike genius, a monument of technical taste, a rare case of a software achievement that technical people can't help feeling expresses the personality of its architect.

I'm with [Gosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling) here.  [Google totally slimed Sun.](http://nighthacks.com/jag/blog/393/index.html)  It's impossible to express just how justified "slimed" feels.  Java wasn't Java because of `max`, `sort`, and a hundred more method signatures like them.  That's like saying [_Dark Side of the Moon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling) is just a bunch of well tuned guitars, chords, and words.  But `max` and `sort` might have been all the Supremes were really given to see.

## Inextricable, Extricated

Given how much of the total impression of Java stems from its holism and consistency, it's particularly tough to see both majority and dissent repeating the idea that Java's declaring code, or API, was "inextricable" from its implementing code.  For one, Google apparently extricated it.  For two, that's the point of an API, at least toward the symbolic manipulation end of the machine-symbol spectrum.

It's not just that you can type `max` as a shorthand for a bunch of `if` statements or `sort` for a fancy loop.  It's that you can use and invoke those shorthands _for functionality_, for intent, with a certain measure of indifference to implementation.  That's especially so in some APIs, like Java's collections APIs, that establish a vocabulary exposing and abstracting over decisions that cross the intent-implementation boundary, like `ArrayList` versus `Vector`.  Those choices---what to expose, what to elide, how to describe it---are an author's work.  And a great deal more creative than many well protected Java programs.

It's true that an API without _any_ implementation isn't useful.  Plenty of useless code falls under copyright, and some is a lot more creative than the "business logic" spinning data center clock cycles day and night.  But the nature of an API, and the crux of an API's role in fostering compatibility, comes precisely from disentangling implementation.  Java written "for Android" today could run on implementations that don't exist yet a few months from now.  Conversely, it's perfectly possible to design and even write out an API before doing any implementation at all.  This is common, and even good practice.

One of the best bits of advice I got on writing C, way back when, was to sketch the header files for my libraries first.  Several of the best JavaScript programmers I know start their packages with drafts of the API, often in `README` or `test.js`.  Sometimes talents and appetites for API design and implementation don't coincide in one person, so one designs the API, and another implements and embellishes, like [Bernie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Taupin) and [Elton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John).  Sometimes one kind of talent does both to start, and the next comes along to refine, like [Ayers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Ayers) after [Kirby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kirby).

I don't expect the Supreme Court to wax rhapsodic about the lofty heights of the craft programmer experience.  But it saddens me to see the verve of the art so totally missing in legal action.  I don't see it in the opinions.  It's a stretch to think it affected the decision, but somehow fell beneath mention.

There was evidence and testimony of the creativity of API design in earlier stages of the lawsuit.  Where did it go?

## Bye Bye Business Models

Speaking of art, if we read _Oracle v. Google_ as the copyright _minimalists_ prefer, the Supreme Court just kicked the chair out from anyone trying to compete on quality API design in the public market.  Especially anyone not already in a leading market position.

That wouldn't mean no new APIs, or new good ones, any more than we won't have new dishes to eat or new clothes to wear.  I strongly suspect it _would_ mean we'll see more of them from the copycat [H&Ms, Zaras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion), and famous-name holding-company restaurants and glossy-page cookbook magazines of the world, rather than small shops and independent creators actually coming up with the goods.  And of course from the big, public tech companies, who make gobs of money otherwise, and spend some of it on R&D, largely to herd and coax us in directions that feed into their business models.

Submit this issue to the [clap-o-meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clap-o-meter) in the court of public coder opinion, I doubt we'll hear much sympathy.  As programmers, we all use more APIs than we create.  But that is a different question from whether we _implement_ more of other people's APIs than our own, or those that belong to our projects and companies.  How often do we invoke APIs for software we're not licensed to use?

While the headlines spoke of APIs generally, to raise the stakes and drive the clicks for each new story on the forever copyright war that kept on giving until this month, it was never clear the Supreme Court would decide anything that broadly, and it still isn't.  The general pattern is that the Supreme Court decides a rather narrow form of the questions put to it.  We all read those decisions like tea leaves, see where it goes in the lower appellate courts, and wait another couple decades for the next round.  Here we go again.

As programmers, and therefore people, we're also preternaturally short-termist, unless we try hard to be otherwise.  Even though we know better.  It's past the resolution of my crystal ball to tell whether a broad application of _Oracle v. Google_ will accelerate or retard API design.  What if the court had ruled that reuse of handwritten machine code was always fair use?  Would we see a more efficient allocation of money, prestige, and resources to the specialists who write that kind of thing, or not?  Would we see small players, who rely on legal protection in lieu of manpower, capital, and market power, edged out or absorbed into FANG, as salaried employees whose copyrights accrue to their overlords?

As programmers, an awful lot of us are on salary.  Employment is experienced as a kind of constructed environment, even a playpen, in which copyrights are only experienced as a hindrance, because all copyrights for our team's work devolve by contract to the employer.  This explains some of what we saw in the briefing for _Oracle v. Google_: big tech companies, allied advocacy groups, salaried R&D group employees, and tenured professors on one side, businesspeople on the other.

In short, workers who are not also businesspeople don't experience copyrights, or copyrights on APIs, as assets.  They don't own their own work, and they're not paid royalties.  They might get a bonus, if they code what they're supposed to and it works out before evaluations.  But they're more likely concerned about losing their jobs if they don't serve up what's ordered.  Turning that into money is somebody else's job.  It matters to the coders financially, if at all, in dilute form, if they get stock or options, and the value of the company appreciates.

We see the same many-versus-few dynamics when it comes programming language designers, compiler programmers, cryptosystem implementers, and any number of fundamental but sparsely populated sub-specialties.  A great may of those specialists choose to make their work available on open terms, APIs and all.  Should they be forced to do so?

## Mega Stakes or Bust

All of this reflects another fundamentally freaky aspect of the Oracle v. Google dispute: its ridiculous scale.

<!-- not just general purpose languages, but databases, libraries, etc. -->

<!-- much as different kinds of creative work share common IP rules, different size organizations share them -->

## Openness

There was nothing stopping us from making APIs "open" before this court decision.  The same old licenses worked on APIs.  The prospect of a broad _Oracle v. Google_ reading is that API developers will be drafted into openness for their work.

Especially FSF-affiliated folks have long brought up legislation mandating that software must be "free" as a talking point, a vision of the kingdom to come.  That's the strong reading of _Oracle v. Google_, not for all software generally, but for the APIs in it specifically.  I don't think this is realistic for APIs, any more than for software.  For languages and other code lower in the stack, the strong reading would preclude some models that the software freedom school would decry.  But in higher level and more specialized software, I suspect we'll see returns to old form.  Maybe I can't stop you from copying my API under copyright law, but I can sell the software under NDA, and prohibit what I want that way.  Copyright was never the whole picture.  Trade secret is also a thing, and the reason copyleft is, too.

As for the open source school, mandatory contribution to the public domain isn't in line with what we've heard from leading lights, either.  Linus has expressed strong, consistent support for the idea that ["if you write your code, it is your choice to pick a license"](https://youtu.be/1Mg5_gxNXTo?t=2963).  Raymond's go-to response for questions about free or open source as communism, which the press loved to tee up for him, emphasize voluntarism.  From [_Revolution OS_](http://revolution-os.com/):

> Interviewer:  People that casually look at open source and free software and think, "well, because you're supposed to share, and do it for people's goodwill, doesn't that seem somewhat communist?" ... what's your response to that?
>
> Raymond:  Absolute nonsense!  It makes me really angry when people do that!  Communism is an ideology that _forces_ people to share.  ... Open source is not communism because it doesn't force people. [Stares.]

A clear legal rule that if you share an API with someone, then you have to share the right to reimplement it, means forcing people to share to an extent they otherwise might not.  Much in the same way that a rule that if you put your source code online, then you have to allow any kind of use, or permit any kinds of changes, is forcing people to take or leave certain kinds of sharing as a package deal.  Some knock-on effects of sharing are inherent in software, human knowledge, and practical realities.  Others come from law.

At various times, Raymond, and not just Raymond, also expressed the view that copyleft licenses like the GPL had become unnecessary, because coders and companies were learning to share whether a license required them to or not, and in any event mandatory sharing does not produce the most enthusiastic, helpful kind of sharers.  The FSF line, in mirror image, was that coders who wanted to share could use the requirement to do so under GPL as leverage to convince their organizations not just to release, but support ongoing participation.

## Assumptions

I can't help mentioning an assertion I've seen repeated constantly in writing about _Oracle v. Google_: the idea that software people have long _assumed_ that APIs can't be copyrighted, and proceeded accordingly.

I've been a programmer since I was a boy.  Longer than I've been a lawyer.  I've also associated with, and worked around, the open side of the spectrum, far more than the closed.  In all that time, I never assimilated any strong view on copyrightability and APIs.  I struggle to think of any other strongly held view of that kind, about an untested and remarkably specific point of legal doctrine, that remotely compares.  Where are programmers meant to have picked up this strong help belief about a fine point of copyright law the courts hadn't reached yet?
