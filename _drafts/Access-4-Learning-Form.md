A non-profit international trade group called [Access 4 Learning](https://a4l.org/about-us/) publishes [a form contract](https://privacy.a4l.org/national-dpa/) that school districts and service providers like e-learning platforms can add to their contracts for services to meet student-privacy legal requirements.  The title page of the version I reviewed, Version 2.1, has these lines:

> Authored by Members of the Student Data Privacy Consortium (SDPC) & Mark Williams, Fagen, Friedman & Fulfrost LLP
>
> Â© Access 4 Learning (A4L) Community. All Rights Reserved.
>
> This document may only be used by A4L Community members and may not be altered in any substantive way.

The [Student Data Privacy Consortium](https://privacy.a4l.org/) is a "Special Interest Group" under A4L focused more specifically on data privacy.

A4L seems to use "Community", always capitalized, specifically to refer to its [dues](https://files.a4l.org/home/Membership/A4L_Community_Membership_Dues_Matrix_May2025.pdf)-paying membership.
