The mythologized "hacker ethic" trumpets freedom and autonomy.  Computers should be free.  Information should be free.  Authority shouldn't exist.  We should judge each other and ourselves by what we can do with computers and information, free of authority, and marvel in the beautiful, life-changing results.

Hacking as a mindset celebrates scratching our own itches.  It provides home-grown frameworks---self-styled "philosophies" and "ethics"---to stroke our own egos.  It provides the justifications to enable our own addictions to interactive computing.  It normalizes rejection of all outside criticism of our values, frameworks, justifications, and choices.  It validates an expectation that hacker supremacy is inevitable, because in the long run, everyone will be a hacker.

Taken to extremes, freedom and autonomy become arrogance and isolation.  The hacker ethic demonstrates arrogance and isolation as well as freedom and autonomy. The tenets of hacking make it insular, parochial, preachy, and alone.  They celebrate a lifestyle where hacking is life and life is reduced to hacking.  They invite us to separate computing from the rest of the world, to make computing its own world, and to pretend that is or should be enough for human beings.

It can be enough, so long as all you want to do is hack, and your only obstacles are people, systems, or licenses that say "no" to your hacking.  That's typical of childhood, even early adulthood, experience.  When childhood has come and gone, the convenient scapegoats of parental and school authority give way to existential angst, the revolutionary benefits of churning out code fail to materialize, and exposure, even incidental exposure, to different experiences, cultures, and concerns .
