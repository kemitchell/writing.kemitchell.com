## Switch to a Russian-Russian Dictionary as Soon as You Can

In college and early on in Moscow, the best portable Russian-English dictionary I found was from [Langenscheidt](https://en.langenscheidt.com/).  It had a durable yellow plastic cover.

I eventually switched to using an iPod Touch, which had great support for mixed Russian and English keyboard input, with dictionary files I found online in a dictionary app I coded myself.  Nowadays, I used Lingvo on iOS.

As soon as you can, switch to looking up new words first in a Russian-to-Russian dictionary.  I strongly prefer the Большой толковый словарь, which is available at <https://vslovarike.ru/> and also through <https://gramota.ru>.  I actually own an imported paper copy of this dictionary for when I really want to sit down at a table and work through some text without distraction.

I like the БТС's shorthand for word forms, with stress.  But when I can't figure out a particular shorthand, I check [Викисловарь](https://ru.wiktionary.org).  Some blessed soul went in there and added all the data from [Зализняк](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%BA,_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87)'s [dictionary](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8F%D0%BA,_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87), so you get nice tables of all forms written out, with stress.

## Look Up Nouns in Russian-Language Encyclopedias

If a new word is a noun, consider looking it up in [Википедия](https://ru.wikipedia.org) or the Russian state [Большая российская энциклопедия](https://bigenc.ru/), rather than a dictionary.  Encyclopedia entries often have way more useful hints about meaning, like pictures.  They also give more examples of the kinds of other words used with particular things, as well as more handy examples of usage in context that you can journal.

## Mark Up What You Read and Review It

I personally underline important parts and circle unfamiliar terms.  If I circle a term, I look up its stress and mark that, too.

## Journal Snippets and New Vocabulary

I keep two parallel journals: one for just unfamiliar words, the other for snippets that include unfamiliar words.  Whenever possible, I try to journal snippets instead of words.  I also try to make this convenient by defining scripts and iOS Shortcuts.

You could use just one journal.  That's effectively what I did, on paper in pocket notebooks, when I was in Russia.

Snippets with terms that I circled in printed reading get journaled.  Examples of usage of new words I look up in encyclopedias and dictionaries get journaled.

In my experience, most of the benefit of journaling comes just from journaling.  Thinking about words you don't know and copying them does a lot of good.  But I believe I've also got some benefit reviewing my journals on a regular schedule.  That can be frustrating, since it means looking at a lot of examples of vocabulary I don't know well at once.  But I don't force myself to look up every single word again, every time.  In time, with more repetitions, I'll get the words.  It's perfectly fine to journal the same word or phrase multiple times, over time.

## Write Stress Marks

It's incredibly tempting to skip past uncertainty about where the stress in words goes by not writing stress marks and pretending that you know.

You will eventually develop absolutely confidence in where the stress goes on many words.  Writing stress marks then becomes just an added hassle.  But you'll pay for allowing yourself to hide by this for words whose stress you never learned, as well as words whose stress you've forgotten or mis-remembered.

## Watch and Listen to Professional Speakers

There are still some broadcasters left adhering to old standards of broadcast pronunciation.  My personal favorites have been Алексей Пивоваров of [Редакция](https://www.youtube.com/@redactsiya), as well his younger colleagues who spun off [Контекст](https://www.youtube.com/@kon_text) after the foreign-agent advertising ban.  Пивоваров's senior colleague Леонид Парфёнов also continues to make some programs under the name [Парфенон](https://www.youtube.com/parfenon).

There are also the [Russian Service of the BBC](https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsrussian) and more recently [Deutsche Welle in Russian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5_GYOnUgL4).

## Embrace Modern Children's Media

## Study Word Roots

For beginners, there is Patrick's [_Roots of the Russian Language_](https://www.amazon.com/Roots-Russian-Language-Elementary-Wordbuilding/dp/0844242675).  Once you're on to using Russian-Russian dictionaries, I strongly recommend [Толковый словобразовательный словарь русского языка](https://ast.ru/book/tolkovyy-slovoobrazovatelnyy-slovar-russkogo-yazyka-044427/), edited by И.А. Ширшов, if you can find it.   Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any public digitized version.

## 1956 Orthography

The canonical grammar of written Russian is Современная русская орфография published by Академия наук in 1956.  There's a nice online version of it at <https://www.therules.ru/>.

Reading this is very hard.  But it's almost always the last source you'll have to read to really pin down a writing question.
