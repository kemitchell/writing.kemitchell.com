Software companies' restrictive licenses and secret source code threatened hackers' sense of freedom, empowerment, and the revolutionary promise of computing machines.  So the truest believers launched a countermovement, originally known as free software, now best known as open source.

Today, open source claims widespread victory.  But software firms' use of open source licenses, methods, and software again threatens hackers' sense of contributing to a better world.  So a new generation turns away away from the figureheads, foundations, firms, and faith tenets of free and open source.

Where are they going?

Some aim to reform open source idealism out of hope that an even opener open source will cure its own ills.  Some seek to revive free software ethics out of reverence for its idealized, precommercial form.  But many have learned from experience that open-source ideology, free-software morality, and the conflicts between them aren't the question or the answer.  They're category error.  Making software open doesn't inevitably make it better.  Making software free doesn't turn `git push` into a virtuous act.

We want to feel good about software we use, software we make, how we make it, and who we make it with.  We need morality to tell us we're right, philosophy to connect it to a greater sense of purpose, and ideology to fill the gaps.  But good morality, philosophy, and ideology don't come from within software.  Good morality, philosophy, and ideology can't be that narrow.  Life is a lot more than software.

The tools and techniques of free and open source software aren't going anywhere.  But they are only tools.  The next great leaps in production, inspiration, and productivity won't take place along the old free-open ideological line.  Free isn't going to win out over open.  Open is closer to winning out over free, but that's the reality that's disappointing us so.

We are learning that good software comes from focus on quality---as judged by its users---not as a byproduct of fervor for any specific license, governance structure, or development style.  We are learning that a lasting sense of greater purpose comes from working with, and serving, users others than ourselves and our kind.  We are learning that a greater sense of right and wrong is a better sense of right and wrong, that we must bring their morality and ideology from outside within it, rather than treating software as a moral or political island unto itself.  We are learning that we can collaborate to express and improve our ethics, in addition to our code.

## Simplicity

> When asking the question "When is it wrong (or right) to use closed-source software?", we should treat it the same way we treat every other ethical question.  First, by being very clear about what harmful consequences we wish to avoid; second, by reasoning from the avoidance of harm to a rule that is minimal and restricts peoples' choices as little as possible.

Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.  When someone promises to make ethics or even politics simple, experience should make us all skeptical.  The guru may be gaining more from the title of moral philosopher than they contribute to right living or even good theory.

That, I fear, has been free and open source software ideology in my lifetime.  Its proponents donned ethical, philosophical, even religious vestments from early on. But both honest analysis and lived experience lay those pretensions bare.

Free and open source ideology oversimplifies hard ethical problems by reducing them to a single domain, software, and a single variable, software freedom.  We're all born free to compute as we please.  Neither computer programmers nor computer companies deserve to impinge.  If they uniformly didn't, life would be swell.

Almost no one's real-world morality boils down to "Can folks do what they wanna?" and a broad expectation that what they'll wanna do will be great.  What's right just isn't so black-and-white. 

Almost no one's real-world politics boils down to "Do folks have an absolute right to X?", where X is speech, assembly, religion, guns, contract, conscience, and so on.  Justice just isn't so black-and-white.

## Appeal

I personally accepted delusions of ethical grandeur and loose use of weighty words like "philosophy" because they imbued my personal choices about software, well within my control, even in childhood, with outsize meaning and importance.  They enabled me to believe that my use of a form license, or even my taste in other peoples' software, amounted to countercultural, charitable, even revolutionary acts.  They did not.  Except in the view of others similarly seduced to self-aggrandizement.

A glancing comparison to nearly any other source of moral teaching available to me, secular or religious, would have shown how simplistic that line of thinking was.  Real moral philosophy remains messy, frustrating, and humbling, like real engineering, real medicine, real social work, and any other discipline that gets dirty in reality.  Real moral codes come riddled with exceptions, littered with factors to weigh and balance.  Software freedom asked little, delivered clarity, felt great, and promised empowerment.  Software freedom analysis boiled down to one long boolean `AND` predicate.

Too good to be true is easy to spot, unless it's too good for _you_.  Then it's damn near impossible.  Software freedom was very good to me.  It _felt_ better, even though it was worse.

I care for those near to me.  I value loyalty, respect, and fairness.  I cherish connections to higher meanings and purposes.  I seek a balance of those concerns and personal liberty when they conflict, as they often do.  As more people and companies get involved in open source, values conflicts are getting hard to miss.

There's no slicing software off from the rest of life and solving it as a disjoint moral problem.  There's no more inherent good in any license or methodology or piece of software software than in the Internet or the English language or the free market.  If there is a morality in free software or open source, it's but a rote specialization of a broader, radical liberal ideology to software.  The more I probe that ideology, the more I find it has little appeal, in light of the problems of concern in my life.  Open source demonstrates the damnable shortcomings of that ideology as well as its strengths.

## Horribles

The path to this realization is well trodden, and increasingly well observed.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom encourage disregard, devaluation, and abuse of people who make software.  I've seen developers browbeaten into slapping permissive licenses on their work not for their benefit, or for any concerete greater good, but for the benefit of those beating their brows.  I've seen bug reports demanding features and fixes gush entitlement … and nary a drop of gratitude.

All of that is profoundly mean.  Blindly maximizing software freedom, privileging one set of people over another because they are users, compromises basic human care.  Nobody wants to contribute to a movement that abuses them.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom birth successive generations of firms competing to reap projects they did not sow, at the expense of their creators.  I've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with growing projects, only to be outdone by runaway incumbents wherever they turned for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  I've seen those incumbents work, consciously and by Darwinian selection, to trumpet the freedoms that play to their advantages, elide the freedoms that level them, and expand the meaning of "open" to the same strategic effect.

All of that is profoundly unfair.  Blindly maximizing software freedom, and gaming what freedom means, compromises essential fairness.  Nobody wants to play a game stacked against them.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable powerful user-come-latelys to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. I've seen burned out developers booted from leadership positions by fresh newcomers waiting in the wings, marginalized and threatened with hostile forks from consortia of household names, and cloned into obscurity by hirelings making bank while the original developers flailed.  I've seen the norm of credit fall from expected condition to broadly ignored chore to "proprietary" mortal sin.

All of this is profoundly disrespectful, and often disloyal.  Blindly maximizing freedom compromises respect and authority.  Nobody wants to join a community as disposable human sacrifice.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable takers to turn makers' work against the very things that inspired them in the first place.  I've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into surveillance, and cryptographic systems into boiler-room scams.  I've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using share-alike tools without a single new line of free source code to show for it.

All of this saps developers' sense of nobility in service.  Blindly maximizing freedoms compromises purpose.  Nobody wants to do free work for the baddies.

This is the interdependence of values in action.  When the only value we measure is freedom, freedom expands to fill all available space, choking loyalty, respect, fairness, purpose, even basic human decency.  Those are the consequences of placing any single value above all others.  We are approaching a local maximum in freedom within software, and sinking everywhere else.

## Selective

I parade these horribles not to paint a one-sided picture of free or open software.  I've written many words on the positive effects that "open" writ large has had on my life and the lives of others.  It still has.

A well worn narrative extols the benefits of free and open source. The costs remain largely disorganized anecdotes, however frequent. Putting both on the table forces a choice:  Do we write off the troubles for the merits?  Do we ignore the merits in light of the troubles?  Or do we try to weigh and balance?  If we weigh and balance, how?

When software-freedom absolutism manages to do some good in any other dimension, true believers happily credit software freedom.  Given absolute freedom, they suppose all other goods would naturally follow.  But when software freedom takes a toll, the faithful blame the victim or write them off as acceptable collateral damage.  You shouldn't have done open source ... like we told you to.  You didn't do it open enough ... my way.  At one point or another, I've wielded all these too-convenient criticisms.

Just as computer programming often reduces a complex problem down to a computable approximation for the sake of efficiency, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside it to grab glittering generalities like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a bad approximation of life.  Just as software reductionism looses well-intentioned, predictably malign systems on the world, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinkered or indifferent to predictable consequences.  When good theory starts from bad assumptions, applying that theory to the world, or forcing the world to fit it, incurs causalities.

Trading completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity often means trading hard decisions and balanced outcomes for easy decisions and predictable mistakes.  The comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, becomes the surest sign of truth, and therefore virtue.  Morality _must_ be reduced to Turing-esque, deductive, boolean reasoning---freedom or no freedom---because acclaim selects for the doctrine that pleases the audience---the ones computing the moral answers---and not those subjected to the conclusions.

Until you realize you'll be subject to the decisions of others more often than they'll be subject to yours.  Until you face your interdependence, master of comuting though you may be.

## Reaction

We a pattern in our politics, broadly.  Those shocked or victimized by abusive structures of authority, loyalty, and religion go all-in on fairness , caring, or freedom.  Exclusive focus on any of those values denies, incredibly, that authority, loyalty, and religion have anything to offer anyone but their elects.  Others come to vilify a single, identifiable font of all affront to their dearest values, be it government, business, "godless communism", or "late capitalism".

All those formative experiences come from life, and all the lessons taken from them reflect genuine living, however dubious their post-hoc rationalizations.  But extermism is ugly in all its forms.  The result of no-common-denominator ideological diversity is an unworkable politics of shouting extremes.  Shouting drowns out the holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated approaches with no clear good-versus-evil lines.  These require a lot more deliberation, but come to good results with far fewer victims.  They accept that no position will win out by exterminating or dominating contrary opinion.

Software is at best a microcosm.  Early free hackers felt oppressed and abused by companies' use of nondisclosure agreements and copyright licenses, which conditioned them to a reflexive libertarianism against business, licenses, and secrecy.  They vilified corporations or intellectual property law, symbolic sources of the only affront consistently felt in their day-to-day: suppression of the growing, presumed-limitless, presumed-positive power of computing.

RMS made a clever deal with the copyright devil for copyleft, but it worked out like deals with the devil usually do.  ESR, a libertarian writ large, distilled software freedom rhetoric to even sharper terms, flipped the ideological color of its presentation, and sought to commercialize the concept, aided greatly by the lack of any deal with the devil to explain.

Now a new generation of programmers feels oppressed and abused _by commercial use of open source_, as a practice and a body of software.  Those experiences condition them to a knee-jerk reflex against open source, by strong association, despite aspects they value very highly, aspects that may have brought them into software in the first place.  When objectors protest, they learn the blessed path is to join a pillar of the system they're protesting as an employee.  Those who refuse and continue to make noise face bully brigades of condemnation.  If [the Borg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg) had a social media team, it might feel like this.

The system has its acknowledged corporate champions.  O'Reilly.  Red Hat.  Now Amazon.  Tomorrow some new network-effect lotto winner.  Most successful open source ventures will amount to also-ran, niche players that the reigning champions of their models will be glad to cite as evidence that they are not in fact monopolies.  To a painfully meaningful extent, any successful open source project with broad commercial appeal is just that much more wind in the sails of the dominant players in the business models that apply to it.  They're wind in the sales of the interestes, politics, and ethics---if any---in symbiosis with those firms.

Despair.  Submit.  Or not.

## Service

> Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
>
> --- Eric Raymond, [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html)

Writing software for yourself short-circuits all the hardest parts of software development.  The shortcut can and does produce good software, but at a terrible price: reinforcing the programmer's personal isolation and the insularity of programming generally.  Hackers seeking a richer kind of collaboration, respect for their role as accomplished specialist, reassurance about the good use and effect of their work, and a higher sense of purpose would do well to include users who _aren't_ programmers in their day-to-day, as deeply and as often as possible.  They'd do well by their peers to encourage the same.

Serving others who _don't_ share your expertise, culture, or lifestyle represents a distinct and important skill.  It's harder than naming things, and must be practiced.  It is not just requirements, user stories, focus groups, and testing.  It is far more than those things, and more than all of them combined.

Scratching your own itches flexes none of the necessary muscles.  

Communicating needs and feedback isn't necessary when the needs and feedback are your own.  So communication atrophies to the acerbic, confrontational engineering tone software is so known for.

Ensuring your work actually addresses a signifiacnt user need happens ipso facto when your own need is your own motivation.  So a thousand web frameworks bloomed while encryption remained impractical for the average Jane or Joe.

A sense of higher purpose was easy when software philosophy exhaulted every release under the right form license, with no expectation of or mechanism for accountable end-user feedback, as a charitable or revolutionary act.  As a greater and greater number of programmers venture outside and report back on the unintentional, negative effects of software on society, that satisfaction gets harder and harder to defend, leaving those without outside connections at a loss for greater purpose.

To develop new skill and strength, follow the usual program.  Reorder your personal priorities, then allow the use of your time to change.  A strong swimmer clocks a lot of fast laps.  A good negotiator closes a lot of tough deals.  A good grief counselor listens through a lot of pain.

The difficulty of those skills makes them valuable.  Getting started takes discipline. But once the virtuous loop of struggle, success, and compelling progress closes, practice becomes play, discipline becomes avocation, and you find yourself getting really, really good at something.  Something that others can value.

As a simple starting point, consider the "buddy stystem":

1. Prioritize programming projects that serve non-programmers' needs, rather than your own.  Especially when you can be in close communication with the person or group of people hoping to use your work from conception through deployment and maintenance.  Build the closest working relationships you can.
2. For projects you maintain, ask contributors and would-be contributors who they're working with, and bring them into discussions as directly as possible.  Better yet, ask users to introduce their developers into your project.  Either way, establish a norm of seeing programmers like agents, doctors, lawyers, or other professionals---incomplete halves of potentially powerful pairs.  Pick your tools and platform accodingly.  Make users welcome first.
3. Make a point to praise peers you see actively and accountably serving others outside of software with their work.  Graciously accept compliments for your own service.  Do good work, and you'll deserve the praise.  Programming as a whole deserves the reinforcement.

There's nothing inherently wrong with itch scratching projects, with projects whose users happen to be programmers, or with projects under permissive licenses doing wholly indeterminate good.  But there is less inherently good about them than we've given ourselves credit for.

Developer tools, libraries, frameworks, and other tools of the trade can and will fall out of good work for non-programmer needs.  But going about things backwards---inside work before outside work---and valuing things also backwards---self sevice and peer service over public service---have systematically closed programming off from the world, made its culture insular.  Which in turn has alienated society from the softare it relies on.

As Adam Smith famously wrote:

> People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.

If he'd mentioned lowering costs or raising margins, and not just raising prices, he'd have covered open source and the software industry, as most software users see it today.  Lots of open collaboration among coders, but not much sign of welcome for anyone else.  Lots of free software that coders can use, but not much software for non-coders without strings attached.

The converse of conspiracy is service.  The antidote to anomie is connection.  If you feel isolated, reach out.  If you're ready to serve, rather than lecture or preach, you'll be welcomed by the kind of people you want in your work.

## Grandeur

What "Scratch your own itch." is the to practice of open source, "Stroke your own ego." is to the idea.  We haven't elevated "Stroke your own ego." to a cliche as we have "Scratch your own itch.".  The onanistic vibe which properly belongs to both looms too pungently around the former.  But as working principles, their effects are the same: isolation, insularity, a lot of specificity about what we do, and a lot of generality about how that's good for the world.

## Dependence

>  Freedom means having control over your own life.  If you use a program to carry out activities in your life, your freedom depends on your having control over the program.  You deserve to have control over the programs you use, and all the more so when you use them for something important in your life.
>
> --- Richard Stallman, [_Free Software is Even More Important Now_](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html)

Reading through the post hoc rationalizations of free softare and open source, it's easy to trace a long-running thread: Everybody was going to be a programmer.  Everybody was going to want to be.

Some professions have gone that way.  Scribes, for example.  But everyday life is littered with professions that didn't.  I hold out great hope that non-lawyers will do more of their own legal work.  But I don't expect that everyone will, or that artificial intelligence will replace me.  I'm no doctor, dentist, priest, and so on, but I doubt they expect the same for their own specialities.  I haven't asked, but I don't think my barber, office janitor, or motorcycle mechanic mentor hold out similar hopes.

I am no less free for relying on those people to live my life.  I am in a sense less independent.  But I revel in the choice of my own dependencies and the connectedness they bring.  I'm grateful for the willingness and availability of others to take control over so many aspects of my life, to steward them better than I would.

My life is richer for it.  All the care, the history, the wonkishness that I put into a license, a policy, or a contract for a client, I can see in the people and work that I rely on.  I can prattle on for hours about computer keyboards, copyleft, and contract law.  When I ask my dental hygienist about the Cavitron, or the x-ray software, or what "SLS" means in toothpaste, it's clear they've made a life in dentistry, and there's a whole life to be made in there.  When I ask my barber about the differences between Korean, Vancouver, and American syles, and whether that has anything to do with all the catholic clergy coming to see him, I get an earful, in English---an extra effort for a Vietnamese boat person.

I'm tempted to preach openness to these people as I know it.  There is something to that:  They may not have considered rowing that directly upstream of the rules and regulations of their work.  It's not an obvious tactic.  But they have showed me every kind of openness more generally speaking that I have ever asked for.  They gladly answer questions of nearly kind, including questions that allow me to do more for myself, without them.  Their willingness is tempered, if at all, by concern that I'll take undue risks with a novice hand, complicate their assumptions about how to serve me well, and the repsonsibility they'll bear for choices not entirely their own.  Even if I never intend to take over, I choose those I depend on in large part by their openness to my curiosity.  I expect clients of my law practice to choose and become comfortable with me at least in part by the same token.
