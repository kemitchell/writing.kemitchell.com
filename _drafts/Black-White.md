Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff.  When a system promises to make ethics simple, life demands we respond skeptically, in proportion to the breadth of our experience.  Simple ethics often gain more from self-identifying as ethics or philosophy than they contribute to workable justice.  That, I fear, has been the case with the ethical underpinnings of free and open source in my lifetime.

Early open-source software stalwarts made the big stage by distilling hard question down to a single factor: freedom.  We're all born free to compute as we please, and neither computer programmers nor computer companies deserve to impinge.  But apart from a few zealots, almost nobody's real-world morality boils down to just "Can folks do what they wanna?"  What's right just isn't so black-and-white.  Especially when you step out of your own niche, and consider the costs and benefits from a broader point of view.

I accepted delusions of ethical grandeur and very loose use of heavy words like "philosophy" because they imbued my personal choices about software, well within my control, with outsize meaning and importance.  They enabled me to believe that my choice of license, or even my choice of other peoples' software, amounted to charitable, countercultural, or even revolutionary acts.  A glancing comparison to nearly any other source of moral teaching I'd been exposed to would have shown how self-aggrandizing and simplistic that line of softare freedom thinking was, especially for a software person.  Real moral philosophy is messy, vague, frustrating, and humbling.  Software freedom asked little, delivered clarity, felt great, and promised empowerment.  Too good to be true is easy to spot, unless it's good for you.

I care about those near to me.  I care about loyalty, respect, and fairness.  I care about connections to higher things and purposes.  I seek a balance of those concerns when they conflict with each other and with freedom, which I also value, as they often do.  As more people and companies get involved in open source, collaboratively and socially, conflicts flare more often.

It's time to admit what I've long really known: There's no slicing software off from the rest of life and solving it as a disjoint moral problem.  There's no more inherent good in any license or methodology or software than in the Internet or the English language or the written word.  If there is a moral philosophy in free software or open source, it's but a faithful application, a rote specialization, of a broader ideology.  The more I probe that ideology, the more I find it has little bearing on the broader problems of personal concern in my life.

## Horribles

The path to this realization is well trodden, and increasingly well observed.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom encourage disregard, devaluation, and abuse of the people who make software.  I've seen developers browbeaten into slapping MIT licenses on their work not for their benefit, but for the benefit of those beating brow.  I've seen bug reports demanding small features and fixes reek of entitlement … and nary a whiff of gratitude.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom encourage firms to systematize reaping projects they did not sow at the expense of their creators.  I've seen developers sacrifice to keep pace with growing projects, only to be outdone by runaway incumbents wherever they turned for a buck: documentation, support, training, consulting, hosting, even swag.  I've seen those incumbents work, consciously and by natural selection, to trumpet the freedoms that play to their advantages, elide the freedoms that level them, and expand the meaning of "open" to like strategic effect.

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable powerful newcomers to undermine the leadership of long-serving creators and maintainers. I've seen developers booted from leadership positions by latecomers, marginalized and threatened by hostile forks from consortia of household names, and cloned into obscurity by hirelings making more than the developer ever did.  I've seen the notion of practical credit for one's work fall from respected license condition to broadly ignored chore to ["proprietary" mortal sin](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/07/27/osi_fury_badgerware/).

I've seen black-and-white software freedom enable takers to turn makers' work against the very things that inspired them in the first place.  I've seen web tech turned into ad tech, computer vision into [surveillance](https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/movidius-brings-its-computer-vision-tech-to-the-worlds-largest-security-camera-maker/), and cryptographic systems into [boiler-room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiler_room_(business)) [scams](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-219).  I've seen it all compiled, debugged, and deployed using copyleft tools with nary a line of new source code to show for it.

This is the interdependence of shared values in action.  When the only value we measure is freedom, freedom expands to fill all available space, choking loyalty, respect, fairness, purpose, and basic human care.  Extremism is ugly in all its forms.  Elevating any single value above all else creates victims.

## Arbitrage

I parade the horribles not to paint a complete picture of free or open software.  I've described elsewhere the positive effect that "open" writ large has had on my life, and still has.  But the merits are well remarked, the troubles suspiciously less so.  Putting both on the table poses a choice:  Do we write off the troubles for the merits?  Do we ignore the merits in light of the troubles?  Or do we try to weigh and balance, and if so, how?

When software-freedom absolutism manages to do some good in any other moral dimension, the true believer happily credits the cause.  But when software freedom takes a toll, the faithful blame the victim---You shouldn't have done open source like we told you to!  You didn't do it open enough!---or simply write the damage off as acceptable collateral of freedom.  I've been guilty both ways.

Black-and-white software freedom, like any black-and-white ethics, trades completeness and gritty realism for expedience and clean clarity.  As usual, that's a bum deal.  Just as computer programming often reduces a complex problem down to a computable approximation, inevitable errors be damned, ethical conversations trapped within software, which only step outside it to draft off vague generalities like "freedom" and "community", derive a neatly computable ethics for a perilously bad approximation of life.  The results can court disaster.

Just as software reductionism looses well-intentioned, malign systems on the world, moral reductionism makes wanton moral automata of otherwise capable consciences, blinded or indifferent to predictable and even visible consequences.  The comfort of sound theory, of easy certainty, becomes the sign of truest virtue.  Morality _must_ be reduced to Turing-esque, deductive boolean reasoning, because acclaim selects for those that please those computing the moral answers, not those subjected to the conclusions.  Until you realize you'll be subject as often or more than you make the decisions.  Until you realize you're interdependent.

## The Usual

We see a similarly pernicious process at work in American politics.

Those shocked or directly oppressed by abusive structures of authority, influence, and religion work out their frustrations by exclusive focus on justice and compassion, denying, more or less, that authority, influence, or religion has anything to offer anyone but their elects.  Others come to vilify a single, identifiable font of all worldly injustice, be it government, big business, "godless communism", or "late capitalism".

All of those formative experiences are real, and all the lessons taken from them genuine, however objectively bunk their post-hoc rationalizations.  But the result of their no-common-denominator diversity is an unworkable politics of shouting extremes, at the expense of more holistic, humble, the-world-is-complicated approaches with no clear good-versus-evil line, but much less collateral damage.

Software is at best a microcosm.  Early free hackers felt oppressed and abused by [companies' use of nondisclosure agreements and copyright licenses](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html), and learned a knee-jerk libertarianism by quasi-[Skinnerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning) conditioning.  They vilified, and made common cause with those who vilified, the single culprit of intellectual property law, symbolic source of the only evil consistently seen in their day-to-day: suppression of the growing, presumed-limitless power of computing.  RMS made a clever deal with the IP devil for copyleft, but it worked out like deals with the devil usually do.

Now a new generation of programmers feels oppressed and abused _by commercial use of open source_.  They are learning a knee-jerk reflex against it, despite aspects they value very highly, aspects that often brought them into software in the first place.  They are learning that doing as open source orthodoxy prescribes, in the best case, can mean getting drawn between a growing project you just can't put down and an industry primed to scout, seize, and strip all sustaining value from up-and-coming projects.

When developers protest, they learn the blessed "ethical" path is to join the system as an employee.  They beat you, so join 'em.  Else you'll face down bully brigades of condemnation for objecting to what seemed plainly wrong.  If the Borg had a social media team, it might feel like this.

O'Reilly.  Red Hat.  Now Amazon.  Tomorrow some new network-effect lotto winner.  Not you.  You can at best form an also-ran, niche player that the reigning champion will be glad to cite as evidence that they are not, in fact, a monopoly capable of crushing all comers.

## Money

I have occasionally met lawyers who seemed to have taken a wrong turn at B School, and wound up in law school instead.  Not I.  I've never coveted a business education, because frankly, I can't read the books without my eyes rolling, and I'm afraid they'll get stuck that way.

But people like me have to care about business models.  Nearly everyone I'm supposed to advise has to care about money, though they'd rather not.  I can answer their license questions all day, but the answers won't be any good if I ignore why they're asking in the first place.

The trick is finding models that:

1. Don't encourage bad or crippled work product.

   Any model that contends for most developer time is out.

2. Work for single developers and small teams, as well as companies.

   Models that require teams of lawyers, salespeople, or separate open and closed development teams are out.

3. Potentially make meaningful money for as many people.

   Swag doesn't cut it.

4. Don't leave them vulnerable to big incumbents with overwhelming structural advantages.

   Support and hosting are out, without proprietary code, infrastructure, or tooling, all crippled-product problems.

5. Don't produce the kinds of network effects that birth big incumbents with overwhelming structural advantages in the first place.

   Reproducing the problem is not a solution.

In simplified terms, my people look for models that scale up, scale down, encourage good code, and send the money back where the code came from.  In value terms, they want _both_ free and fair, where free is the only path paved so far.

## Elimination

The original free software business model, payment for copies of software, was fair in free software's formative years.  RMS's nascent Free Software Foundation sold [dead-tree manuals and copies of Emacs on tape](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~trent/gnu/bull/16/gnu_bulletin_28.html), which as far as I can tell was all that held him back from full anti-commerce out of the gate.  But the same massive cost shift that made freedom seem crushingly important, the Internet, also gutted distribution as a meaningful moneymaker.  By then, FSF had won the donations-model lottery, and didn't much have to care.

As I have [mapped out systematically before](https://blog.licensezero.com/2018/10/17/mapping-models.html#purebred-models-overview), that leaves [public-private licensing](https://indieopensource.com/public-private/indies) (AKA dual licensing AKA selling exceptions) and [delayed release](https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/06/relicensing-sentry/), a species of dual licensing with some licensing choices preset by schedule.  All these models rely on the developer, a company, or [another vehicle](https://xlcollaborative.com/) wielding unique power to ignore the terms of the public license for the code and to offer others who don't have that superpower different terms for a price.

From a broad, multifaceted moral perspective, that kind of unilateral power makes perfect sense.  Morally speaking, the maker of a project _are_ morally special with respect to their own work.  They deserve to reinforce the connection between maker and work that we know as "fairness", "authority", "merit", "credit" and so on---the missing moral dimensions of the freedom-blinkered view.  When someone other than the maker knowingly profits from their work at their expense, that's wrong.  When project leadership gets run over roughshod by self-serving newcomers, that's wrong.  When resources rather than track record drive development, that's wrong.  When forks and clones steal the limelight of hard-won ideas and innovations, that's wrong.  Unless freedom is all that determines right and wrong.

## Competitive Lexicography

Giving the developer or group that happened to make the software special powers frustrates those whose goal is to pick the fruits of the work.  The fruits, unlike the software, may be quite scarce and rivalrous.

If you want to move in and outcompete the maker on paid distribution, you can't have them keeping distribution rights or build tooling to themselves.  So projects that do "aren't real open source" even with core code stands free for all to read and use.

If you want to outcompete the maker on support or maintenance services, you can't have them controlling access to documentation or gatekeeping governance.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", as we sometimes hear about Clojure, the foundation of a sprawling, healthy, [shockingly mature](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) collaborative effort.

If you want to outcompete the maker on hosting, you can't have them requiring you to release your proprietary hosting stack.  So projects that do "aren't real open source", as we heard about MongoDB's Server Side Public License.

I don't for a minute think that everyone who holds an extended or exclusionary view of "open source" schemes to screw devs.  There are other, valid reasons, moral and intellectual, to support each of those positions.  But reading history written by commercial stalwarts, and bearing in mind their enormous powers of marketing, recruiting, and lobbying, it's no surprise that "open source" has shifted toward those views that singleton representatives of successive business-model innovations favor, both as byproduct of corporate involvement and by direct, concerted political action.

Permissive, not copyleft, and certainly not the [scary kind](https://paritylicense.com).  Not just code, but docs, guides, and scripts, too, but not on terms we don't like.  Not just a license, but governance, meetings, foundations, and codes of conduct, but HR-friendly ones, and nothing radical.  Enforcement, but [not the kind that hurts](https://www.fsf.org/licensing/enforcement-principles), and [surrender your weapons at the door](https://gplcc.github.io/gplcc/).

Winners' history leaves me asking:  Was the moral foundation of free software, before open source coopted it, really so narrow?  I find that hard to believe.  But it's a question of purely historical significance now.  What open source will mean, and whether we will continue to pretend that it has innate moral character, as we once believed the Internet could only do good, is a question of the future and present experience, not the past.
