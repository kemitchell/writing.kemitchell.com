What are the controversies of the day in free and open licensing?  Here's my view, not from the clouds, but from the trenches.

<h2 id="patents">Patents, Standards, and Reference Implementations</h2>
Patent-law practice and largely copyright-driven software licensing practice are colliding in standards bodies, from which contributors increasingly want to release reference implementations of their standards in software, and to make those reference implementations open source.

The standards-setting community has long relied on a compromise known as FRAND: fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory.  Within standards-setting, the game for many large companies is to influence the standard to require practicing as many of their own exclusive patents as possible.  To prevent companies laying those kinds of traps, standards bodies require companies to commit to licensing any patents they get into the standards on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms.  That compromise enables big companies to participate in standard setting.

FRAND licenses terms aren't free and open license terms.  Modern open software licenses explicitly cover patents, and grant broad permission totally free of charge.  But some popular old licenses, including MIT and BSD, don't explicitly mention patents, and arguably don't cover them.  So the first solution to the patents-in-reference-implementations problem, from the patent practice side, was to pick MIT or BSD for the code.  From the software licensing side, that looks like sham open source.

My Take:  Best case, the standards community revisits _patentleft_: patent licenses that cover free and open implementations.  The life sciences are now far ahead of software on that front.  Second-best, the standards fly their own flag and come up with new licenses that make clear there's no patent grant, rather than introducing confusion about old terms like MIT and BSD.

<h2 id="weak">Stronger Weak Copyleft</h2>

My Take:  Both businesses and activists need stronger copyleft licenses.  Starting from that strong-copyleft basis, companies should be welcome to grant exceptions for applications developed with their software.  That was welcome at the dawn of "open source", when Netscape pioneered the approach to make its web browser open, permitting closed plugins, to keep it competitive with Internet Explorer, but without permitting competitors to simply absorb or fork its code.
