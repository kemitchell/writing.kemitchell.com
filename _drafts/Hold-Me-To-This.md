Open-source software left its mark on me long before law school.  I am still learning all the myriad ways the damage done utterly disqualifies me for "lawyers' lawyer" status.  Nowhere at home.

For example, open-source software people and American lawyers fetishize very different kinds of authority.  Sure, software has its share of "[benevolent dictators for life][BDFL]".  Like judges, they make opinions that carry weight of their political authority publicly known.  But they are expected to show much, much more work.

Imagine if CSPAN not only had cameras at oral arguments and trials, but also in judge's conferences ... and copies of all the internal court e-mail about each opinion, drafts included.  Imagine if every decision of a court born of less transparent process were stripped of precedential weight.  Or if folks just started filing into a new, upstart court across the street that makes more to-do of being open.  Snappy dress codes, fancy buildings, and all manner of hokey verbal decorum don't help in that kind of world.  They're the mark of the poser.

At least in the circles I travel, this is how software people want their community to function.  Their are some very well known examples---recent [OpenSSL] vulnerabilities like [Heartbleed] come to mind---showing that reviewable and improvable aren't sufficient.  But on the whole, at the level of ideals, culture, and values, software born of a process deemed closed or opaque publicity at nearly any stage---"proprietary software"---is inherently suspect.  As are programmers who don't submit their work to the public ordeal, which is all kinds of performance anxiety inducing when you start out.

A number of my clients seek me out precisely because I'm wired for this and other values of the community, as they are.  When I hand these folks dense agreements about securities, intellectual property, and commercial agreements, they are more likely to trust that I'm representing their goals and values in the system.  They also tend to read every word I prepare for them.  The frequency and completeness with which this happens tend to shock my somewhat skeptical legal colleagues.

Eventually, I end up giving them something---anything---that I've either reworked in a "plain language" style or written from scratch.  The reaction tends to
