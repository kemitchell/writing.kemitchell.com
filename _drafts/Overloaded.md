Boosterism would have us look upon FOSS as an eternal parade of morally instructive triumphs.  Experience suggests we'd better look and learn from mistakes, as well.  Terminology represents a particularly rich vein of persistent hacker folly-fantasy, right through the history of doing computer software online.

This post kicks off a new, running series, [_Overloaded_](/series/overloaded), addressing terms in open licensing we use in multiple, potentially confusing ways.  I'm going to suggest new, finer-pointed distinctions _within_ those terms, not in place of the terms we've settled on, but in addition to them.  I'll be tackling a few to start, then others as they come to me.

Key terms from "relicensing" through "dual licensing" and "open source" itself cause endless misunderstandings and misperceptions.  Yet no one has the power to dislodge established usages, or even to stop naming collisions from happening in the first place.  No one owns the language.  And no one's that witty.

I have been guilty of thinking I might be, a mistake I could have learned to avoid care of one Richard M. Stallman.  I've tried various coinages for specific kinds of "dual licensing", for example, occasionally on this and other blogs.  I'm tempted to resist the latest semantic outbreak of "Artificial Intelligence", too, by sharpening the hook on "fake smarts" or some similar barb.  It's all as hopeless as the FSF's [dog pound of no-no words](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html).

At best, "forking" off the common parlance facilitates a smug self-satisfaction for the speaker, some conspiratorial smirks for fellow travelers, and a warm burble of in-group esprit for the collective, assuming no one pipes up in objection to pop the mood.  Mostly it just makes you harder to understand.  For those who do understand, and understand why you choose to make yourself obscure, it's nice physical therapy for any underused eye-roll muscles.  "Service as a Software Substitute" and similar aren't even so much sour grapes as old vinegar.  "Software as a Service" has been sipping champagne for years.
