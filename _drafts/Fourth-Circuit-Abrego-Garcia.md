The [latest court opinion](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/88/abrego-garcia-v-noem/) in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, of the El Salvador nationals deported from the United States to the CECOT prison in El Salvador, is one of the rare ones I'd encourage more people to read.  The judge clearly took time and care to put some of it in language people _not_ mind-warped by legal education could read, understand, quote, and share.  But the very layout and typography of legal opinions can be off-putting.  Here's a line-by-line read, first quoting, then giving whatever thoughts I have.

Please take into account that I not an immigration lawyer, or even a lawyer who handles court cases.  I advise and negotiate.  It's still part of my job to follow and understand what goes on in the courts, and especially the written decisions that come out of them, but it's not part of my toolkit to know all the twists and turns of court procedure or the looser norms of standard operating policy, in this or any other legal area.  Still, I'm hardly the only lawyer leaning over to follow this case.

## The Header

> United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit

The hierarchical structure of US federal courts has three major levels: district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court.  The middle-tier courts are called "circuit courts" because judges used to travel around, or "ride a circuit", to hear appeals from cases of the district courts within a given territory.  These days circuit court judges mostly stay put, working out of their own permanent courthouses.

The [Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit](https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/) covers federal districts in the states of Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.  Abrego García lived and was arrested in the District of Maryland, and his wife sued in federal district court there.

District courts are trial courts.  That's where people sue, get sued, submit evidence, hold trials, and get decisions.

> No. 25-1404
> (8:25-cv-00951-PX)

These are tracking numbers for the case.  The first is from the Fourth Circuit, for the appeal.  You can use the second, longer, -cv- number to track the case as it bounces around between different courts and levels of the legal system on free repositories like [Court Listener](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/abrego-garcia-v-noem/).  The official government site is [PACER](https://www.pacer.uscourts.gov/), but it's shamefully pay-gated and a pain to use.

## The Parties

After the numbers come the names of the parties---the two sides involved in the lawsuit.

> Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia;

one of the Salvadoran nationals deported to El Salvador

Federal courts, their secretaries, and their case management systems still ain't great about [diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic), but some are getting better at [Spanish-style names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs).  So no Abrego Garc<em>í</em>a, but we will see him referred to as "Abrego Garcia" below.

> Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura;

Abrego García's wife, probably written Vásquez in Spanish

> A.A.V., a minor, by and through his next friend and mother, Jennifer Vasquez Sura,

their child

It's typical for minor children and some other categories of vulnerable people to be named with pseudonyms or initials.

> Plaintiffs – Appellees,

This is the list of people in whose names the lawsuit was brought.  In the lawsuit, down in the federal district court, they are "plaintiffs".  In this appeal to the Fourth Circuit above it, they are "appellees", the ones on the receiving end of the appeal, since the government was the side unhappy with what the trial court did, and appealed.

> v.

We'll see the relevant hierarchy of the executive branch on the other side:

> Kristi Noem;

currently serving United States Secretary of Homeland Security

> Todd Lyons;

acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security

> Kenneth Genalo;

acting Executive Associate Director Enforcement & Removal Operations Immigration and Customs Enforcement

> Nikita Baker;

acting Field Office Director for ICE in Baltimore, Maryland, where Abrego García lived

> Pamela Jo Bondi;

serving United States Attorney General

> Marco Rubio,

serving United States Secretary of State

> Defendants – Appellants.

These are the defendants at the trial court level, since they're the ones who got sued.  But they're the appellants at the appeals court, since they're the ones who applied to have the higher court to overrule the lower court's order.

## The Decision

> Order

Courts and judges turn out a few different kinds of documents.  This is an order.  They are ordering something be done.

### The Judges

Next comes the bit about who is doing the ordering and the writing.

> Wilkinson, Circuit Judge,

James Harvie Wilkinson III, [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Harvie_Wilkinson_III), 80 years old

appointed by Ronald Reagan to the Fourth Circuit in 1984, chief judge there since 1996

> with whom King

Robert Bruce King, [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bruce_King), 85 years old

appointed by Bill Clinton to the Fourth Circuit in 1998

> and Thacker,

Stephanie Thacker, [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Thacker), 59 years old

appointed by Barack Obama to the Fourth Circuit in 2012

> Circuit Judges, join:

So Wilkinson wrote this order, but King and Thacker agreed and cosigned.

## The Explanation

> Upon review of the government's motion, the court denies the motion for an emergency stay pending appeal and for a writ of mandamus.

Lots of jargon here.

A _motion_ is a document filed by one side or the other in a lawsuit, asking the court to do something.  There's a whole decision tree of what motions who can file when.  That's "legal procedure".

In this particular appeal, the government filed [the motion](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/86/abrego-garcia-v-noem/).  Their ask was for "emergency stay" of an order by District of Maryland trial court judge [Paula Xinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Xinis), appointed by Obama in 2016.  That [order](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/21/abrego-garcia-v-noem/) required the administration to "facilitate and effectuate the return of Plaintiff Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States by no later than 11:59 on Monday, April 7, 2025".

Essentially, the government asked the appeals court to press the pause button on that order while they argue to overturn it.  They also want an order from the appeals court down to the lower court, a "writ of mandamus", canceling, or "vacating", [another order](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69777799/79/abrego-garcia-v-noem/) about giving the plaintiffs access to documents and evidence, a process called ["discovery"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)).

> The relief the government is requesting is both extraordinary and premature.

"Relief" here means "what they are asking the court to do for them".  In everyday English, "What the government is asking us to do is both strange and hasty."

> While we fully respect the Executive's robust assertion of its Article II powers, we shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the Supreme Court's recent decision.

[Article II of the US Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-2/) is the article covering the powers of the Executive Branch, led by the President.

The appeals court calling the district court judge below a "fine district judge" is an implicit response to recent public criticism of sitting judges by the President and his allies.  John Roberts, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, [responded more directly](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/john-roberts-donald-trump-impeach-federal-judges-00235742) after criticism of [James Boasberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Boasberg), chief judge for the District of Columbia, for ordering the administration to turn planes headed to El Salvador back in another case.

The Supreme Court has given two decisions on the deportations to El Salvador now, one on the case handled by Boasberg, and now this one handled by Xinis.  Those decisions have been subjects of some of the most depressingly lazy and slanted news coverage I've seen in a long time.  Partly this is down to the Supreme Court playing somewhat subtly.  But only very partly.

The Supreme Court's [April 7 decision in Boasberg's case](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a931_2c83.pdf)---not counting the separate, individual opinions tacked onto the back of it---runs only four pages.  My major takeaways were:

1.  The deportees appealed to the Supreme Court in the wrong way.

    This didn't seem legally wrong, but fits nicely into a long pattern of federal courts avoiding direct conflict with other branches of government by finding narrow, technical ways to decide cases with broader implications.  There was [a good law review article about this back in 2018](https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-131/the-endgame-of-administrative-law/), abstract at the top.

2.  Since they were held in Texas at the time they sued, they should have sued there, not in DC.

    This vindicated the government's apparent ["forum shopping"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_shopping) strategy of arresting and immediately moving people to a federal district in Texas under the [Fifth Circuit](https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/), where the government expects judges to rule in its favor more often.

3.  People the government wants to deport under the Alien Enemies Act, the reason Trump gave for deporting to El Salvador, have to be notified and given a chance to sue---in the right way, in the right court---to stop it.

    In other words, due process still applies.

The Supreme Court's decision in this particular case, by Abrego García, came just a few days later, on [April 10](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a949_lkhn.pdf).  The prompt was the government's request to throw out the order of the Maryland district court judge.  My takeaways there:

1.  The Supreme Court acknowledged that the Maryland judge's deadline for returning Abrego García had already run out by the time they decided, but they left the rest of the order in place.

2.  "The order properly requires the Government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador."

3.  The word "effectuate" in the lower court's order, on the other hand, needed clarification, to avoid overstepping into the executive branch's role.

4.  "For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps."

    This left open the possibility of ordering the government to report on what it has done, and to potentially sanction for failure to follow its orders to do or report.

I am _not_ an expert in immigration law, or even in litigation.  But my impression is that it's normal to leave an order like the one being considered in place while it's appealed.  The general idea is that the judge on the front line, running the trial in the district court, gets some latitude to manage the process, keep things on track, and make initial decisions.  If they get an order wrong, the appeals process can correct it, but until that happens, those on the receiving end must wait and obey.  Appeal is about correcting orders, not requiring higher-level sign-off for them in the first place.

This is related to another live legal issue since Donald Trump's inauguration: the ability of federal trial court judges to rule that government actions are unconstitutional or otherwise illegal and order the government to pause or stop them nationwide.  Your search term there is "nationwide injunctions", injunctions being a kind of court order to one of the sides in a lawsuit.

> It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter.  But in this case, it is not hard at all.  The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.  Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done.

This is very direct, serious language.  The judge is trying to pierce through the jargon and the maze of procedure to write something to be read and quoted beyond the usual audience of lawyers and specialists.

"Rid itself of custody" here refers to the government having handed Abrego García off to Salvadorian authorities in El Salvador.

> ¶ This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.

Candidly, this is why this particular companies-contracts-privacy-security-IP lawyer has been following the dockets on these cases.

> ¶ The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a member of MS-13.  Perhaps, but perhaps not.  Regardless, he is still entitled to due process.

I read this as a direct response to the efforts of the presidential administration to "try him in the press": repeatedly saying that he _is_ a member of MS-13, holding pressers about him, publicizing the paper trails of his immigration process and domestic drama.

One of the benefits of trying someone in the press is lower standards of evidence.  You can show and tell things that would never fly in court.  You don't even have to argue the same questions.  Even if the government had already proven to a jury, beyond any reasonable doubt, that Abrego García was a gang member and a criminal, even if he'd admitted all that under oath, he'd still be entitled to due process of law.  There's nothing in the Supreme Court's decisions that separates Abrego García, who was or wasn't a gang member, from those who were, proven or unproven.  Everybody gets due process.

Abrego García has been separated by the fact that he and his wife brought this lawsuit.  And that they managed to do so on very short notice, while he was still in the Fourth Circuit, before they moved him to Texas, under the Fifth Circuit.  How that will play out specifically, and what difference it will make, if any, in the end, remains to be seen.

> If the government is confident of its position, it should be assured that position will prevail in proceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order.  See 8 C.F.R. § 208.24(f) (requiring that the government prove "by a preponderance of evidence" that the alien is no longer entitled to a withholding of removal).

The judge made an effort to speak plainly above, but seems to lapse back a bit here.  In American English, I'd put it so: "If the government's so sure it can prove Abrego García's a terrorist and an MS-13 member, it should go to immigration court, prove it, and get the order it violated against deporting him back to El Salvador overturned".

"8 C.F.R. § 208.24(f)" is a legal citation in the weird shorthand layers use to refer to other documents.  It refers to the [Code of Federal Regulations, Title 8, Section 208.24(f)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-208/subpart-A/section-208.24).  The Code of Federal Regulations is where the federal government compiles all the various regulations written by agencies.

"Preponderance of the evidence" is a legal term for one of the "standards of proof", somewhat vague but extremely important ideas about how strongly one side or the other of a lawsuit has to prove its case to get a court or jury to rule in its favor.  "Preponderance of the evidence" is the lower standard usually used outside of criminal court, where "beyond a reasonable doubt" is the standard under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.

> Moreover, the government has conceded that Abrego Garcia was wrongly or "mistakenly" deported.  Why then should it not make what was wrong, right?

A Justice Department lawyer admitted both in court and in a [filing](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815/gov.uscourts.mdd.578815.11.0.pdf) that ICE deported Abrego García despite knowing about its order against deporting him to El Salvador.  That lawyer, Erez Reuveni, was soon [suspended](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5235778-doj-suspends-lawyer-deportation-case/) for not pushing hard enough.

> ¶ The Supreme Court's decision remains, as always, our guidepost.

This is preemptive self-defense.  The government seems intent on appealing every chance it gets.  All paths up lead eventually to the Supreme Court.

> That decision rightly requires the lower federal courts to give "due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs."  _Noem v. Abrego Garcia_, No. 24A949, slip op. at 2 (U.S. Apr. 10, 2025); see also _United States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp._, 299 U.S. 304, 319 (1936).

The string of names, abbreviations, and numbers is another legal citation.  The first pointer is to the Supreme Court's decision in this case, specifically page 2 of it.  Then there's another pointer, to [an older Supreme Court decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Curtiss-Wright_Export_Corp.) about the president's foreign policy role and powers.

"Slip op." stands for "slip opinion".  That's how lawyers cite recent court opinions that haven't been been bound up in the big books, or "reporters", that decisions get formally published in, a bit like [preprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) in science.  The reporter for Supreme Court decisions is "United States Reports", abbreviated "U.S".  The older _Curtiss-Wright_ decision was published in volume 299 of United States Reports, starting on page 304.  It was decided in 1936, the number in parentheses.

> That would allow sensitive diplomatic negotiations to be removed from public view.  It would recognize as well that the "facilitation" of Abrego Garcia's return leaves the Executive Branch with options in the execution to which the courts in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision should extend a genuine deference.  That decision struck a balance that does not permit lower courts to leave Article II by the wayside.

All this points back to the Supreme Court's requirement that courts be careful ordering the government to "effectuate" getting Abrego García back out.  By pointing out the freedom of choice and action the government still has while following the order, it makes the point that the courts aren't trying to micromanage the executive branch, as if by remote control.

> ¶ The Supreme Court's decision does not, however, allow the government to do essentially nothing.  It requires the government "to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador."  _Abrego Garcia_, supra, slip op. at 2.

On theme of following the Supreme Court's say-so, citing it again.

> "Facilitate" is an active verb.  It requires that steps be taken as the Supreme Court has made perfectly clear.  _See_ _Abrego Garcia_, _supra_, slip op. at 2 ("[T]he Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.").

The meanings of words can always be argued, but courts have rules for that, too.

The "supra" in the citation just means "cited already above".

> The plain and active meaning of the word cannot be diluted by its constriction, as the government would have it, to a narrow term of art.

A very lawyerly sentence.  Playing interpreter again, I might put this as "We can't read the plain, broad, active word 'facilitate' in some weaker, specific legal way."

Lawyers use "term of art" for words and phrases with special meanings in law.  Sometimes these words have meaning in everyday English, but also different meanings in law.  For example, while "consideration" usually means thinking about something, in contracts law it refers to a basic rule that courts will only enforce private agreements where there was give and take on both sides.

Speaking of multiple meanings, the court might have meant "construction", a term of art for "how judges interpret language", rather than "constriction".  But constriction makes sense, too.

> We are not bound in this context by a definition crafted by an administrative agency and contained in a mere policy directive.  _Cf._ _Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo_, 603 U.S. 369, 400 (2024);  _Christensen v. Harris Cnty._, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000).

"ICE can't tell us how to read the word in a press release."

[_Loper Bright_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loper_Bright_Enterprises_v._Raimondo) was a very recent Supreme Court decision overturning a rule called "Chevron Deference".  Chevron Deference told courts to listen to agencies' readings of ambiguous laws in many circumstances.  That was a long-sought result for many Republican-affiliated interests, and one I wouldn't have expected without Republican nominees becoming the majority on the Supreme Court.  The big political implications have been in regulation, such as [environmental regulations](https://environmentalenergybrief.sidley.com/2024/07/02/environmental-law-implications-of-loper-bright-and-the-end-of-chevron-deference/).  But it's a huge change to a very general rule with applications across tons of laws and agencies.

Citing it here, on immigration, could be read as a bit of zinger.  As well as more demo that they're following the Supreme Court, not running rogue.

> Thus, the government’s argument that all it must do is "remove any domestic barriers to [Abrego Garcia's] return,"  Mot. for Stay at 2, is not well taken in light of the Supreme Court's command that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.

"Mot." stands for motion.  The citation is to the document the government filed asking to overturn the district court's order.

Note the emphasis on the Supreme Court again.  The Supremes got to be very subtle in their writing.  They didn't have to spell out direct commands to the government afresh and sign them, just leave what the trial court wrote "in effect", with some notes.  But it's no stretch to say the Supreme Court gave command by doing so.  That was the _effect_ of their words.

> ¶ "Facilitation" does not permit the admittedly erroneous deportation of an individual to the one country's prisons that the withholding order forbids and, further, to do so in disregard of a court order that the government not so subtly spurns.

Very pointed now.

> "Facilitation" does not sanction the abrogation of habeas corpus through the transfer of custody to foreign detention centers in the manner attempted here.

Repetition---["anaphora"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphora_(rhetoric))---for emphasis.

"Habeas corpus" is an ancient, bedrock legal right to challenge being held or imprisoned by the government.  Article I of the Constitution prohibits Congress from suspending it "unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it".  Wikipedia has an [extensive entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States#Suspension_during_Reconstruction) on its history in the United States, including suspensions, most notably during and after the Civil War.

> Allowing all this would "facilitate" foreign detention more than it would domestic return.

Clearly tired of games about what "facilitate" means.

> It would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness and tarnish the very values for which Americans of diverse views and persuasions have always stood.

The first of a few huge, unironic statements of broad principle.  Most lawyers, even many judges, serve entire careers seemingly a long way off any case where this could be written without serious risk of over-dramatization.

I try to imagine writing it as a federal judge of 80 years.  I have to admit I likely fail to imagine.

> ¶ The government is obviously frustrated and displeased with the rulings of the court.  Let one thing be clear.  Court rulings are not above criticism.  Criticism keeps us on our toes and helps us do a better job.  _See_ _Cooper v. Aaron_, 358 U.S. 1, 24 (1958) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) ("Criticism need not be stilled.  Active obstruction or defiance is barred.").

[_Cooper v. Aaron_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_v._Aaron) was the Supreme Court decision in the [Little Rock Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine) public school racial integration affair after [_Brown v. Board of Education_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education).  The syntax of the citation marks the quote in parentheses as coming from the court's opinion in _Cooper_.

> Court rulings can overstep, and they can further intrude upon the prerogatives of other branches.

They can step on the toes of Congress and the Executive, doing what the Constitution leaves up to them, rather than the courts.

> Courts thus speak with the knowledge of their imperfections but also with a sense that they instill a fidelity to law that would be sorely missed in their absence.

The idea that the senior judge of a federal appeals court is thinking about a nation without courts is deeply unsettling.

> ¶ "Energy in the [E]xecutive" is much to be respected. [<span class="smallcaps">Federalist NO. 70</span>](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-04-02-0221), at 423 (1789) (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961).  It can rescue government from its lassitude and recalibrate imbalances too long left unexamined.

Getting a little lofty now.

"Lassitude" means basically tiredness or weariness.  Borrowed from French.  Like "plaintiff", "defendant", "appellant", and "appellee".

> The knowledge that executive energy is a perishable quality understandably breeds impatience with the courts.  Courts, in turn, are frequently attuned to caution and are often uneasy with the Executive Branch's breakneck pace.

I'd venture to guess Wilkinson isn't only referring to the Trump administration here.  He's been an appeals court judge more than forty years now.

> ¶ And the differences do not end there.  The Executive is inherently focused upon ends; the Judiciary much more so upon means.  Ends are bestowed on the Executive by electoral outcomes.  Means are entrusted to all of government, but most especially to the Judiciary by the Constitution itself.

There's a kind of mirror-image view here of the Supreme Court's picking at "effectuate".  One response to charges that the courts are overreaching into executive business is that the courts are only ordering what has to be done, not how to do it.  Go get Abrego García out.  Take your pick of "options in the execution"---ways of getting it done.  Keep negotiations secret if you want to.

> ¶ The Executive possesses enormous powers to prosecute and to deport, but with powers come restraints.  If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?[Footnote]

When it comes to basic legal rights, there is always a latent risk of further, more serious abuse.  It takes the form of a slippery-slope argument, which is a relatively weak form, but one in grim historial precedents.  Drama put it perhaps better than life in the famous devil dialogue of Bolt's [_A Man for All Seasons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_for_All_Seasons_(play)).  We are about to get it again, in non-fiction.

I can follow what is going on, but I can't pretend to guess all the whys.  It strikes me that the government has presented, perhaps purposed to present, this issue in a very particular way.  Think of a group commanding less public sympathy than hundreds of immigrants tarred as foreign gang members?  Their sheer number of would defy personal empathy, as perhaps it still does for the hundreds or others flown away _not_ admitted in court as deported by mistake?  What area of law commands less respect, from all sides, than US immigration?  Who has the stomach to read about the maybe-maybe-nots of what courts can order as penalties against the government for ignoring the orders of its own courts, after the Big Court admitted it blew its deadline?

> And what assurance shall there be that the Executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?  The threat, even if not the actuality, would always be present, and the Executive's obligation to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed" would lose its meaning.  <span class="smallcaps">U.S. Const.</span> art. II, § 3; _see also_ _id._ art. II, § 1, cl. 8.

"And, when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you---where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?"

> ¶ Today, both the United States and the El Salvadoran governments disclaim any authority and/or responsibility to return Abrego Garcia.  _See_ _President Trump Participates in a Bilateral Meeting with the President of El Salvador_, <span class="smallcaps">White House</span> (Apr. 14, 2025).  We are told that neither government has the power to act.  The result will be to leave matters generally and Abrego Garcia specifically in an interminable limbo without recourse to law of any sort.

Calling out the [runaround](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/runaround).

> ¶ The basic differences between the branches mandate a serious effort at mutual respect.  The respect that courts must accord the Executive must be reciprocated by the Executive's respect for the courts.  Too often today this has not been the case, as calls for impeachment of judges for decisions the Executive disfavors and exhortations to disregard court orders sadly illustrate.

"Get what you give."

> ¶ It is in this atmosphere that we are reminded of President Eisenhower's sage example.  Putting his "personal opinions" aside, President Eisenhower honored his "inescapable" duty to enforce the Supreme Court's decision in _Brown v. Board of Education II_ to desegregate schools "with all deliberate speed."  Address by the President of the United States, Delivered from his Office at the White House 1-2 (Sept. 24, 1957); 349 U.S. 294, 301 (1955).  This great man expressed his unflagging belief that "[t]he very basis of our individual rights and freedoms is the certainty that the President and the Executive Branch of Government will support and [e]nsure the carrying out of the decisions of the Federal Courts."  Id. at 3.  Indeed, in our late Executive's own words, "[u]nless the President did so, anarchy would result."  _Id._

C-SPAN has posted their recording of the address [to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzT5v_ICU6I&t=27s), if you're interested.

> ¶ Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.  This is a losing proposition all around.  The Judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply.  The Executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions.  The Executive may succeed for a time in weakening the courts, but over time history will script the tragic gap between what was and all that might have been, and law in time will sign its epitaph.

I think "dent" should be "dint" here, personally, but that's courts moving quickly for you.  All of this has happened at remarkable speed.

> ¶ It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well.  We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.  This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.

Skirting the term ["constitutional crisis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis).  I share a kind of allergy to that term.  It's way more clear that it means "big drama" than anything more specific than that.  It's more igniter than useful fuel.  Authors writing about it nearly always define it some new way, for themselves, or [avoid it altogether](https://hls.harvard.edu/bibliography/constitutional-showdowns/).  But I'm not aware of a better term for irreconcilable conflicts between branches of government.

The point above was "get what you give".  The court lives that law, in deed, by ruling against the administration haranguing it.  But in word, here comes an olive branch.

A huge open question, hardly legal: How will those meant to receive the offer read it?  As an "opportunity"?  Or only as a sign of weakness?

> ¶ In sum, and for the reasons foregoing, we deny the motion for the stay pending appeal and the writ of mandamus in this case.  It is so ordered.

The traditional procedural sign-off setting out the move the court is making within the decision tree of legal procedure and making clear it's using its power to give orders.

"/s/" is for "conformed signature".  It's the law's way of showing in type that a signature appears here in the original.  In this case, the clerk of the court's.
