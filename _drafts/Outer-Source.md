Open Source suggests that we can separate Free Software method and Free Software quality from Free Software ethos, by leading with method and quality, and going light on ethos in its pitch.  That suggestion contradicts Free Software's thesis that method and quality flow out of shared ethos.  Putting ethos last, rather than first, disaffirms Free Software's ethical emphasis.  So Open Source threatens Free Software, and tells us so.

Inner Source delivers on that threat.  Inner Source means transposing Free Software method into closed environments to produce closed software of high quality.  That transposition rejects the Free Software thesis that Free Software quality flows from Free Software ethos.  The "Inner" in "Inner Source" bespeaks a closed environment, a barrier between "Inner" and "Outer", impermeable to Software Freedom and unpierced by copyleft.  Inner Source frees those within, and subjugates those without.

Merely suggesting the separability that Inner Source stands for allows proponents to claim that Open Source and Free Software mean the same.  They describe Open Source as a mere rebranding of Free Software, a marketing reboot.  They hold out hope that exposure to Free Software method and Free Software quality will guide newcomers back to the underlying ethos.

Inner Source contradicts that theory of Software Freedom ministry.  If Free Software method in a closed environment can produce Free Software quality on its own, even if only to a lesser extent than in the open, then Free Software ethos loses any essential part to play when quality drives the question.  The leap from conviction in software quality to conviction in Free Software ethos can happen only spontaneously, by reading the right sermons to those already predisposed.

Even Software Freedom activists embrace this approach.  Most notably, the Free Software Foundation maintains developer tools as useful to non-Free Software developers as Free Software developers.  Software Freedom activists compromise their principles, and make exceptions to their own licenses, allowing use of these tools to build non-Free Software, to preserve the projects as soap boxes.  They choose to proselytize by popularity, at the expense of principle.  In doing so, Free Software activists themselves lead with method and quality, instead of ethos, and suggest the same challenge to their own core thesis that Open Source does.

Addicts come to twelve-step programs for sobriety, not religion.  But the higher power is step two.  Developers come to Open Source for software quality and method.  But the Software Freedom lede is buried, and not essential to the program.  There's no necessary step from quality and method to Free Software ethos.

Many developers' interests in method and quality start and end with their desires to sell non-Free Software for money.  That motivation directly contradicts the ethos Software Freedom activists want to preach.  For these developers, converting to Software Freedom activism through Free Software method makes about as much sense as kicking drink by turning will and life over to Bacchus.

Splitting method and quality from ethos via Inner Source leaves a yawning conceptual gap.  Inner Source, using open software development methods to make closed software, implies _Outer Source_: using closed software development methods to make open software.  The idea that commerce-evolved, institutional, "corporate" software development methods can produce high quality, publicly available software lingers latent in developer consciousness, just as Inner Source did.

Symptomatically, lasting attempts to demarcate Free Software and Open Source focus entirely on rights granted for software already produced, ignoring development method.  The Debian Free Software Guidelines and Open Source Definition assess not what method produced a given work of software, but whether others got source source and sufficiently generous licenses for it.  None of the organizations holding out a definition requires that contributors welcome or accept outside patches, solicit outside bug reports, publish their revision-control history, or maintain any public governance structure.

Every developer harbors process preferences.  Some development methodologies surpass language communities in tribalism.  But no self-identifying movement could coalesce by inviting development creeds to clash.  Only by reducing the scope of agreement to the lower common denominator---source availability and license terms---could anyone lay a broad enough base to claim consensus.

Commentators still delight in the novelty Linux' anarchic, piecepart, Brownian motion mode of evolution.  Contrast with waterfall-model planning and Microsoft's Windows made for high drama, as drama about software methodology goes.  Naturally, the anti-establishment narrative elided a great many uninteresting facts.  Facts, for example, about the solitary origins of many components of modular projects, like the GNU core.  Facts about the development of banner Free Software projects by corporations, largely along "traditional" industry development lines, before widespread Internet penetration and process standardization.  Substantial parts of the Free Software bequest have always come about like non-Free Software programs before them.

We see Outer Source reasserting itself mostly in quiet corners.  My favorite example [comes from SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html#notopencontrib):

> ## Open-Source, not Open-Contribution
>
> SQLite is open-source, meaning that you can make as many copies of it as you want and do whatever you want with those copies, without limitation.  But SQLite is not open-contribution.  In order to keep SQLite in the public domain and ensure that the code does not become contaminated with proprietary or licensed content, the project does not accept patches from unknown persons.
>
> All of the code in SQLite is original, having been written specifically for use by SQLite.  No code has been copied from unknown sources on the internet.

The exception is licenses.  Many companies give away software developed primarily in-house: because they hire developers and put them to work on the project, because they habitually hire outside developers who express interest, or both.  When those companies propose new licenses, usually strong copyleft licenses, to protect themselves strategically and financially, they face several classes of criticism.

I [recently described](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2018/11/04/Copyleft-Bust-Up.html) one such class of criticism.  Software Freedom activists, prioritizing ethos, criticize new strong-copyleft licenses that they see as overreaching, such as by requiring contribution of private changes.  They criticize strong-copyleft licenses that apply copyleft's requirements selectively, allowing specific uses that deprive users downstream of Software Freedom.

Outer Source developers also face criticism from process partisans.  New licenses from Outer Source companies facilitate, and therefore threaten to promote, Outer Source development methods, at the expense of "community-driven development" mindshare.  For example, [strong-copyleft licenses that facilitate dual-licensing business models](https://github.com/licensezero/parity-public-license) catch heat, not just from those who dislike copyleft in general, but from those who [criticize contributor license agreements](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2018/01/06/CLAs-Are-Not-a-Sham.html) and other policies that place the steward company in a privileged position, even if the only effective privilege is [selling copyleft exceptions](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/selling-exceptions) and [maintaining closed forks, extensions, applications, and services](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

The strong retort to process-based criticism emphasizes the common-denominator natures of Free Software and Open Source, and the history of latent diversity in its development methods.  As Rich Hickey [put it most cogently](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9), late last year:

> Open source is a licensing and delivery mechanism, period.  It means you get the source for software and the right to use and modify it.  All social impositions associated with it, including the idea of 'community-driven-development' are part of a recently-invented mythology with little basis in how things actually work, a mythology that embodies, cult-like, both a lack of support for diversity in the ways things can work and a pervasive sense of communal entitlement.

Rich Hickey's best-known project, the Clojure programming language, [requires contributors to sign a contributor license agreement, based on Oracle's form, but centralizing license rights in Rich personally, instead of a corporation](https://clojure.org/community/contributing).  Clojure receives outside contributors, but Rich's company, Cognitect, pays those who do the greater share.  Opinions always vary.  But by the straw poll of my own experience, I've heard Clojure held out as a paragon of design and quality as often as any other modern, active project.  It needn't apologize for its process.  Which I take as the larger point of Rich's piece.
