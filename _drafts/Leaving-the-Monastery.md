I'm seeing a lot of crossfire in open source along these lines:

> --- Bad things are happening when we use make our work open source.  We need new rules.
>
> --- That's not open source.  Stop calling it that.
>
> --- It's open source to us.  And it's the right thing to do.
>
> --- You're forcing your personal business failures, or your personal ethics, on others.  Stop it.

At this point, it's plenty clear to anyone _else_ that folks are talking past each other.  Best case, they simply walk away and have a think about it.  But usually, they just keep typing into the void, doubling down, and getting testier, instead.  Word counts mount, each side's partisans smell a chance to score points on their side---if not on the other---and vague anxieties about online representation of their point of view invite more shout performances.  Engagement mounts, so I suppose the platforms are happy.  But everyone actually involved just wastes their time.

Seeing this play staged over and over again involves a lot of deep sighs on my end, because I've played both parts, and not self-consciously.  I've played the guy who's eager and proud to know the right open-source answer, righteous defender of the revolution.  I've name-dropped the Open Source Initiative, trumpeted its Open Source Definition, and deployed fluent FSF philosophy-speak.  And I've played the guy writing and supporting new licenses, for business reasons and activist reasons, for myself and for others.  I've backed new indie devs and activists when they called their software open.

There's no failure of communication sparking off these flame wars.  Each side understands the points the other side is making, as written, and has probably read and understood them before.  There is instead a failure of mutual appreciation.  Each point of view understands and expresses itself in its own vocabulary, which embodies different assumptions about what points matter, and why.  But points that count on one side simply don't register on the other, so there's no way to talk about the conflict in a way that's meaningful on both sides.

I'd like to offer one.  Call it "insularity".  Call it "specialization".  Call it whatever you like.  The question boils down to:

Should programming try to separate itself off from other business, social, and technical concerns, as a kind of hermitage or neutral zone?  Or should it instead embrace its universal applicability and interconnectedness, and responsibility beyond the merely technical?

The archetype of free and open software's best-known banner names is the obsessive, quasi-monastic computer nerd shut-in who constructs, relishes, and defends the cloistered, obsessive lifestyle of the compulsive hacker.  Linus and Stallman spent multiple, formative years doing little else but programming.  They're people, and they've both broadened and mellowed with age.  But at their most potent, and as we still seem them, symbolically, they were hardly paragons of well-roundedness.

The one-sided stereotype has always been simplistic and unfair.  Not everyone who does a lot of programming
