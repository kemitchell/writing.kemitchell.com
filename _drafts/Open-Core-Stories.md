"Open core" means proprietary software.  We call it "open core" to suggest that proprietary software comes from an open place.  Proprietary in practice, but open at heart.  Open if we could be, proprietary because we have to be.

When we use "open core" as a kind of apologia, its mute, defensive vibe can strike the right tone.  But the louder companies and the industry declare that open core is a bona fide, established, viable, unapologetic _thing_, the less that note rings true to anyone else.   Declaring for all the world to hear that you are proud of, and defined by, your regrettable compromises is not a great story.  No one is inspired to run out and compromise.

If you want to make software, but can't or won't just give all away unconditionally and for free, there are three good stories the industry knows how to hear and tell.  This post will lay them out, one by one, so you can decide which appeal to you, and whether you can walk their walk and talk their talk.  Better yet, perhaps you'll add a new one of your own.

<h2 id="business">This is a business.</h2>
Rent is reality.  Medical bills are reality.  Retirement costs are reality.  If someone's surprised or offended to find a business lurking behind good software, that's their naivete or simple selfishness acting out, not a righteous rebuke for any moral failing or unfair ambush on your part.  It's not for your company to sweat the Neverland expectations of those who've only just got out of college, or took jobs at large companies that do their best to provide a seamless, infantilizing transition.

I strongly suspect that most business folks who find "open core" helpful came to the intersection of open and proprietary from the open side.  That explains the generally apologetic vibe.  But it's perfectly possible to start from business _as_ business and work back to openness by deduction from received business wisdom alone.  Freemium and loss-leader strategies---pejoratively, "bait and switch" or "first hit's free"---show up all over the place, not just in software.  "Free" as applied to software means "open source".

Especially if hard-nosed business realism story _doesn't_ appeal to you intuitively, I strongly recommend that you read up on just how solid the business case for open source can be without any ideological or developer-empowerment valences.  Read [_Information Rules_](https://books.kemitchell.com/books/information-rules), a kind of short-course in applying traditional economic principles to information goods.  It's twenty years old now, predating the marketing ascendancy of "open source".  Read [_The Cathedral and the Bazaar_](https://books.kemitchell.com/books/cathedral-bazaar), and marvel at just how direct, transparent, and amateurish was the "open source" appeal to business types in its infancy.

<h2 id="fair">This is fair.</h2>
Rewarding the people behind good software is fundamentally fair.  If you make ends meet by charging others to use your software or services, you should expect those whose software and services you use in turn to make ends meet by charging you.

Companies that appeal to fundamental fairness tend to nail the enlightened self-interest point.  Users should _want_ to reward producers, if producers are good for them.  Compensation problems blow back on production.  If you don't reward software developers fairly, you can expect less good software to use and choose from.  At a very minimum, users should want to keep producers off desperation's door, where they might be tempted to do something drastic.

But overall, companies haven't tended to tell the fairness story well.  They almost always fail on consistency.

A company that wants to invoke fairness on its own behalf doesn't take a superior moral position by simply invoking the Golden Rule.  A company insisting on the Golden Rule for itself---"Amazon should do unto us as Amazon would have its customers do unto Amazon", for example---comes across conniving and hollow without mention of the wronged company's own suppliers and dependencies, without mention of what's been done to do right by them.  Frequently, pointing this out leads to a similarly hollow rejoinder:  We will do unto others as we want done unto us ... as soon as we get our checks.  That's a big if, and demands a lot of trust.  Our money now.  Their money someday, maybe, later.

If the fairness angle appeals to your moral suasion, be prepared to show and tell a consistent moral position.  Understand and accept that you are wading into a hard, messy labor issue.  Read up on medieval guilds and journeymen associations.  Read up on unions and inter-union relations.  Read up on the professions and antitrust.  Read up on how those institutions fail.

<h2 id="movement">This is a movement.</h2>

If there's one story software people are used to hearing, it's the story of a protest movement.  The mythos of the Free Software Foundation redounds in it.

Early free software activists were handsomely rewarded, but not with what they asked for.  Mostly, they were celebrated for side effects or byproducts of their activism that hurt as much as helped their activist causes.  There is more free and open software at this moment than ever before.  But it is getting harder, not easier, to live a full, connected life without relying on opaque, abusive software systems controlled by others.  Meanwhile, opaque, abusive software systems controlled by others often get built with lots of tools, techniques, and infrastructure "native" to free and open practice.

As a result, the standard for mission-driven credibility has risen.  It's no longer enough to articulate a vision, a struggle, a philosophy, and a program.  One must also demonstrate _strong antibodies_---inbuilt, essential mechanisms that prevent the thing you are trying to protest from coopting your work.  Movements that can't play strong defense, in addition to compelling offense, are presumed dead, and more than a little naive, on arrival.

Whether it's "software freedom" or "the right to privacy" or the end of "intellectual property" or "decentralization", if a mission-focused story appeals to you, I can't recommend strongly enough that you read about movements in other domains, literally any domain but software.  Read about suffrage and prohibition.  Read about the Sierra Club and the Tea Party.  Read about the American revolution and Rhodesia.  Pay extra attention to when and how things went wrong.  Read RMS again, and think about how futuristic and idealistic it seems ... after thirty three years of the Free Software Foundation.

## Combos

These stories are not mutually exclusive.  Software history teaches that companies, foundations, and other groups can tell more than one at a time, and that telling more than one is often more than twice as effective.  Just as specific stories may have appealed to you---perhaps movement and fairness, but not really business---different stories will appeal to others---perhaps business and fairness, but not really movement.  The more you can tell in a compelling way, the more folks you can reach with a story they find compelling.

Recent history also teaches that it's incredibly difficult to _fake_ any one of these narratives for any meaningful length of time.  Disappointments double:  Falling short of the image you project affects not only how others see your company, from the outside looking in, but how insiders see themselves and the company they work for.  The way you portray your company will have a lot to do with who and how you hire, and when and how they choose to leave.

The Free Software Foundation's a convenient reference point yet again.  It has long told a compelling mission-based story.  It has long taken pains, here and there, to emphasize that it isn't against, and even supports, business use of and contribution to free software.  But their business line, their nods to financial and practical necessity, never felt particularly whole-hearted.  They admit to life's practicalities a apologetically or regretfully, not assertively.  They don't want to drive folks who find the business angle compelling away from free software, but that's not where they come from.

## Experiences

The FSF's flexibility in welcoming business interests without going out of its way to do so points to a fundamental tension in open source, and now in open core.  There are definitions and essays and books to read about what free or open source software mean, but in practice, that's not how we learn, any more than we learn what "software" means by reading a dictionary or encyclopedia.  We stumble into open source, or get invited, and have any number of experiences and conversations.  Those experiences and conversations become our personal working definitions of open source.

Different folks' experiences often share commonalities, but they are rarely the same.  Open source appeals to different people for different reasons: empowerment, politics, camaraderies, efficiency, and so on.  Different experiences also lead to different views and preferences on specific issues, from choice of source code repository to project governance and funding models.  Those differences lie latent behind the very general notion of open source, which points more reliably to the good thoughts and feelings from our experiences, which we share, rather than the specifics of actual experiences, which we often don't.

As a result, open source persists as one of those phrases like "freedom", "community", "liberty", "synergy", and "innovation" with an almost perfectly positive _connotation_, and not much reliable _denotation_.  Like singing Kum ba yah around a campfire or hearing a stump speech from a politician you already like, when you're feeling it, it's uplifting, even transcendent.  But when you're not feeling it, the same experience can feel sappy, affected, and more than a little disturbing, especially when everyone else really seems to be into it.

"Open core" makes the latent contradictions in open source feelings and open source feelings hard to ignore, like "essentially free" or "community license".  If the marketing value of "open core" is "open", and "open" holds value precisely because the link from open appearance to open reality, from open generalities to open specifics, is so stretchy, then inviting others to recognize the difference risks breaking the spell.  So open core works to extinguish the very momentarily, unstable opportunity that it relies on for its marketing bump.  Better, long term, to call it what it is.  Perhaps "commercial open source".  Perhaps "enterprise pays" or "when you make money, we make money".  Perhaps "public benefit software business".

## Tollbooth

Even if two people who love open source with all their hearts can't be relied on to agree on much of anything specific in an absolute sense, there are definitely trends and heuristics.  From where I'm sitting, one particular kind of happy introduction to open source has far eclipsed others in popularity: sudden and exhilarating developer empowerment.

Imagine that you set off on a bicycle through a forest park, aiming to summit a large hill in the distance.  A few miles into your journey, you find yourself suddenly not on flat land, but at the crest of a different hill, on the way to your destination.  Heading down the side of this surprise hill, you stop pedaling, and let the grade carry you faster and faster down the slope, freewheel clicking louder and louder, the wind rushing by you without the slightest effort.  What's more, as you reach the bottom of this surprise hill, you find yourself at the base of the hill you meant to climb.  Carrying momentum from your unexpected descent, you get a massive push up the next climb, ascending effortlessly with no effort.

Finding yourself coasting down the steep slope of an unexpected hill is happening upon the treasure trove of existing open source that meets your needs as a developer.  Suddenly your project---ascending the hill to your destination---seems far more attainable, in less time and with less effort, than you anticipated starting out.  A project that once gave you concern about your abilities, and a twinge of lingering impostor syndrome, now leaves you feeling validated and accomplished.  You still have some pedaling to do.  But the great boost you've been given left you feeling, for a moment, like a superhero.

It's a power fantasy.  But for many of us, it's been very, very real.

Back in reality, open core companies are busy setting up toll booths at the bottoms of those hills, which they have built and great earthwork projects, and maintain day by day.  They hope that the boost you'll gain from discovering their free work will make you and your company ready, willing, and able to pay their toll when the time comes, to maintain your momentum up whatever hill of business problems you're actually out to climb.
