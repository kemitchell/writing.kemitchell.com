> A contract may validly include the provisions of a document not physically a part of the basic contract.  As stated in _Scott's Valley Fruit Exchange v. Growser Refrigeration Co._, 81 Cal.App.2d 437, at p. 447 [184 P.2d 183]: (Disapproved on an inapplicable point in _Hischenmoeller v. National Ice etc. Storage Co._, 46 Cal.2d 318, 328 [294 P.d 433].) "It is, of course, the law that the parties may incorporate by reference into their contract the terms of some other document. [Citations.] But each case must turn on on its facts. [Citation.] For the terms of another document to be incorporated into the document executed by the parties the reference must be clear and unequivocal, the reference must be called to the attention of the other party and he must consent thereto, and the terms of the incorporated document must be known or easily available to the contracting parties."

For the terms of another document to be incorporated into the document executed by the parties the reference must be clear and unequivocal, the reference must be called to the attention of the other party and he must consent thereto, and the terms of the incorporated document must consent thereto, and the terms of the incorporated document must be known or easily available to the contracting parties.

## Restatement Second of Contracts

> The memorandum may consist of several writings if one of the writings is signed and the writings in the circumstances clearly indicate that they relate to the same transaction. §132.

> Explicit incorporation by reference is unnecessary, but if the connection depends on evidence outside the writings, the evidence of connection must be clear and convincing. Comment a.

> When two or more documents are signed by the party to be charged, they may be read together even though neither contains any reference to the other.  The question whether they constitute a sufficient memorandum is substantially the same as if they had been incorporated in a single document. Comment b.
