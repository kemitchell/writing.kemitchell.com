Making basic balloon animals that kids love is a lot easier than most people think.

The key is good balloons.  If you get quality balloons designed for twisting, some will still pop here and there.  But it will go from discouragingly often to tolerably rare.  It's amazing how much good balloons can take.

## Step 1: Acquire Basic Supplies

1.  Balloons

    Buy an assorted color bag of [Qualatex](https://us.qualatex.com/) size 260Q balloons.  I get mine [on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=qualatex+260+assortment+bag).

    Try to buy from a seller that looks like they sell a lot of balloons.  You can keep your balloons for years, but if you get old ones that have already been on some warehouse shelf for half a decade, they might go brittle, and you'll have a harder time.

    For folks outside North America, I have read that [Sempertex](https://www.sempertext.com), based in Columbia, also makes good twisting balloons.  I've also read that [Betallatex](https://www.betallic.com), out of St. Louis, makes good ones.  But I haven't tried them.

2.  Pump

    Buy whatever full-size, manual, double-action balloon pump Qualatex makes.

    Here is the one I have:

    Consider getting two---one for you, one for any precocious kid that wants to try.

    I do _not_ recommend the "pocket pump" Qualatex offers.  It's much slower, harder to hold, and mine blew a gasket after a year.

4.  Permanent Marker

    A couple medium, black Sharpie markers will do.  Mostly for drawing eyes and spots.

5.  Apron

    If you see yourself standing up or moving around as you twist, get yourself a half-apron or waist apron with big front pockets, like fancy restaurant waitstaff wear, to hold your pumps and balloons.  I fold mine in half, so it hangs shorter, just around my waist.

## Step 2: Work Through Some Tutorials

Go watch a few videos from [Michael Floyd's "Balloon Animals for Beginners" series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzpMuO1BnJQ&list=PLkbFkY1_qG3jGNHOFlSxXBpgreM5ChyAq).  Start from the beginning.  Learning to tie off might be the hardest part.

_Important Note_:  Michael's a pro.  He inflates with his mouth.  Don't expect to be able to do that without a lot of practice.  Use your pump.

If you take to twisting, make sure you watch through [his "Ask the Balloon Guy" series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLbCs5qYOCQ&list=PLkbFkY1_qG3hC7IFVxCev8XISEhDksQi9), too.  Lots of great tips.

## Step 3: Go For It

You can entertain a whole kids' party for hours just making noodles, swords, and one-twist crowns.  If you can make a dog, you're more than ready.

## Step 4: Understand the Act

I'm not sure if I heard this first from Michael or from someone else.  But I've definitely found it to be true:

- The youngest kids really just want attention and a balloon.  Mostly attention.  The simplest shapes, presented in a personal way, will make them very happy.  Let them pick the color.

- Older kids want to be impressed, or to get a balloon they can impress their friends with.  They are the most challenging.

- Adults with kids want their kids happy.

- Adults without kids just want a laugh.

## Step 5: Strategize a Little

You can't stop balloons popping once you've handed them over.  But if you're working with kids particularly given to startle and cry, avoid shapes with pinch twists or pulls through, like one-balloon teddy bears and frogs.

Also avoid orange balloons where you can, as at least with Qualatex, those seem to pop more often.  You might keep orange balloons in a separate pocket so you can pull them out for specific shapes, like giraffes, but leave them out of the colors you offer as choices for other shapes.
