A number of people have asked me for hints on which open source licenses to read, in order to develop a working understanding of the field.  The following list suggests a number of licenses, in a specific order, designed to help develop understanding.

## Notes to Readers

When this program says _read_, read very carefully, at least twice.  Take notes as you go.  Don't skip any terms.  Get as much out of each license as possible.

When this program says _compare_, run a machine text-to-text comparison, using a word processor's compare-documents feature.  Then read the comparison very carefully, at least twice.  Ask yourself:  Why do these licenses differ?  Get as much out of each comparison as possible.

When this program does not explicitly tell you to compare, compare anyway.  Don't take any license on its own.  Ask how it differs from other forms, in style and in substance.  Ask yourself _why_ it differs.

This list might seem long, but each license is fairly short, as legal reading goes.  In the end, there is not that much source material.

Be a legal vampire.  Suck every last drop of meaning from every last license section and comparison.  That effort, not finishing this list, will determine what you get out of this program.

## Teaching Notes

This program makes crucial use of Lawrence Rosen's AFL and OSL.  Those are not particularly popular licenses.  But the textual comparison directly emphasizes the basic difference between permissive/academic and copyleft/reciprocal.  I don't think there's a better license pair---BSD and Sleepycat?---to drive that difference home.

The licenses under [Review](#review) will be the most relevant and popular for most practitioners.  If I really, really had to cut this course down, I'd assign just those licenses.  If I had to cut the course down substantially, but not that far, I would likely skip the reciprocal licenses and antilicenses, or cull them down to RPL 1.5 and WTFPL or Unlicense, respectively.
