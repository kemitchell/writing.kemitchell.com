[Blue Oak Council](https://blueoakcouncil.org), a nonprofit I cofounded some years back, has published a [primer on open software licensing](https://blueoakcouncil.org/primer).  The page is based on an old guide of mine, "Open Source: Theory of Operation", with lots of great updates, improvements, and feedback from colleagues and readers.

This will be my go-to recommendation for a short, comprehensive guide to the fundamental legal underpinnings of free, open source, and similar software licenses going forward.
