In any number of conversations, I've pointed out that a share-alike or "copyleft" license could apply _across_ different kinds of work.  For example, a software license could require sharing alike of artwork made with the software.  A license for digital artwork could require sharing alike of software incorporating that artwork.

Here's a sketch of actual terms from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/berneout/universal-copyleft-license):
