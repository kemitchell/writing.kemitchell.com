[Blue Oak Council](https://blueoakcouncil.org), of which I was a founding member, just published a [new guide to open software representations and warranties in mergers and acquisitions](http://localhost:4000/mergers-and-acquisitions), the kinds of deals where one company combines with or buys another.

I'm proud to have contributed, and Blue Oak Council has more improvements in the works.  If you have feedback of your own, feel free to let me know at [kyle@kemitchell.com](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com).
