Happy to announce [version 1.0.0-pre.2 of the Big Time Public License](https://bigtimelicense.com/versions/1.0.0-pre.2), a new public software license that's free for noncommercial and small businesses use and guarantees bigger businesses that fair commercial licenses will be available for them.  Several folks are after me for this license, and I'm looking to finalize a 1.0.0 within the year.

The crux of Big Time is the guarantee for businesses that _don't_ qualify for use for free, which takes the form of a fallback license:

> ## Large Business
>
> Use of the software for the benefit of your company is use for a permitted purpose:
>
> 1.  during the first 128 days after that use stops qualifying as a permitted purpose under [Small Business](#small-business)
>
> 2.  indefinitely, if the licensor or their legal successor does not offer a fair commercial license for the software within 32 days of [written request](#how-to-request)

Those terms rely on two definitions:

> A **fair commercial license** permits the recipient to do everything that these terms allows companies qualifying under [Small Business](#small-business) to do, for a fair fee, without additional unreasonable terms or terms that discriminate against particular licensees.  A fair commercial license may be perpetual or for a term, and may or may not cover new versions of the software.

> A **fair fee** is a fair market price for a fair commercial license.  If the licensor advertises a fee for generally available fair commercial licenses, and more than one unaffiliated customer has paid that price in the past year, that is a fair fee.  However, a fair fee may not be more than:
>
> 1.  on an annual basis, the number of software developers who have made substantial technical contributions to the software in the last four years times 0.25 times the annual wage for software developers reported in the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Statistics survey
>
> 2.  on a perpetual basis, two times a fair fee on an annual basis

The license text shares much in common with [Polyform](https://polyformproject.org)'s Noncommercial and Small-Business licenses.

Feedback is most welcome [on GitHub](https://github.com/berneout/big-time-public-license) and [by e-mail](mailto@kyle@kemitchell.com).

I blogged about some design challenges in this kind of license [in another blog post earlier this month](/2019/12/02/Correct-Intuitive-Fairness.html).
