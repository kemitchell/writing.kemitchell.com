The best single-article overview I've seen so far is [Ali and Clark's "Qualified Immunity: Explained"](https://theappeal.org/qualified-immunity-explained/) for [The Appeal](https://theappeal.org), from June of 2019.

Primary Sources:

- [42 U.S.C. 1983](https://downloads.kemitchell.com/OPD/42 USC 1983.pdf), from [the Enforcement Act of 1871](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Enforcement_Act)

- [Pierson v. Ray](https://downloads.kemitchell.com/OPD/Pierson v Ray.pdf) (1967)

- [Harlow v. Fitzgerald](https://downloads.kemitchell.com/OPD/Harlow v Fitzgerald.pdf) (1982)

- [Malley v. Briggs](https://downloads.kemitchell.com/OPD/Malley v Briggs.pdf) (1986)

- [Hope v. Pelzer](https://downloads.kemitchell.com/OPD/Hope v Pelzer.pdf) (2002)
