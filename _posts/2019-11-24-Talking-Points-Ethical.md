Thanks to [http://lifeofaudrey.com/2019/11/24/links-floss-ethics.html](http://lifeofaudrey.com/2019/11/24/links-floss-ethics.html), I was able to catch up on a few blog posts about "ethical licenses" that I'd missed.   During that reading, I began collecting common arguments against, along with responses of my own, on a [talking points page](https://talkingpoints.kemitchell.com/ethical-licenses.html).

I intend to keep that page as a living document, hence the new subdomain.  If you have feedback or suggestions, feel free to send my way [via GitHub](https://talkingpoints.kemitchell.com/ethical-licenses.html).
