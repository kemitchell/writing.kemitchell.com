Thanks to [Audrey Eschright](http://lifeofaudrey.com/2019/11/24/links-floss-ethics.html), I was able to catch up on a few blog posts about "ethical licenses" that I'd missed.   During that reading, I began collecting repeated arguments against, along with responses of my own, on a [talking points page](https://writing.kemitchell.com/living/Ethical-Licenses-Talking-Points).

I intend to keep that page as a living document.  If you have feedback or suggestions, feel free to send my way [via GitHub](https://github.com/kemitchell/writing.kemitchell.com/blob/master/_living_documents/Ethical-Licenses-Talking-Points.md).
