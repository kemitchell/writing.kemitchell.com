While [browsing Ken Adams' blog](https://www.adamsdrafting.com/in-contract-drafting-its-better-to-be-right-than-experienced/) today, I scrolled down the bottom of one of his posts.  Ken's blog uses [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments.  At the very bottom of the comment space, I saw a link, "Do Not Sell My Data".  Having clicked that link, I ended up on [this page](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/) reading this right at the top:

> We've detected that the Do Not Track setting is currently enabled for your browser.  In order to opt into our ad training program, you must first disable this browser setting.

Interesting.
