I'm happy to announce [the 1.0.0 release of the recently rechristened API Copyleft License](https://github.com/kemitchell/api-copyleft-license/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

This was only possible with wonderful feedback from several people:

- Theo Belaire
- Josh Berkus
- Ben Hilburn
- Adam Jacob
- Alexis Richardson
- Luis Villa

Looking forward to more proposals and discussions [on GitHub](https://github.com/kemitchell/api-copyleft-license).  Version 1.0.0 is a good license.  But like all the license I work on, I expect that it will continue to evolve.

The text of version 1.0.0 follows:

> # API Copyleft License

>
> ## Applications
>
> You need not contribute software that only invokes this software's functionality through the interfaces this software exposes, without exposing this software's interfaces and functionality to other software.
>
> Interfaces exposed by this software include all the interfaces this software provides users or other software to invoke its functionality, such as command line, graphical, application programming, remote procedure call, and inter-process communication interfaces.
>
> ## Contributing
>
> When this license requires you to contribute software:
>
> First, publish all source code for that software, in the preferred form for making changes, through a freely accessible distribution system widely used for similar source code, so the developer and others can find and copy it.
>
> Second, ensure that each part of that source code is licensed to the public under one of these:
>
> 1.  [The BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause-Patent.html)
>
> 2.  terms with substantially the same legal effect as [Copyright](#copyright), [Patent](#patent), and [Reliability](#reliability), and optionally a rule like [Notices](#notices), a disclaimer like [Disclaimer](#disclaimer), or both, but no other terms
>
> 3.  this license
>
> Take these steps within thirty calendar days of creating or using the software for the first time.
>
> ## Excuse
>
> You are excused for unknowingly breaking [Notices](#notices) or [Copyleft](#copyleft) if you do what the rule requires, or stop doing anything requiring this license, within thirty days of learning you broke the rule.
