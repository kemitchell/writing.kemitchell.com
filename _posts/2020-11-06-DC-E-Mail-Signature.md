[D.C. Toedt](https://www.oncontracts.com/) has published two reports of deals signed by having the two sides reply "Agreed." by e-mail, [the first](https://www.oncontracts.com/contract-by-email-example/) in September, [the second](https://www.oncontracts.com/sign-contract-email-exchange/) just today.  I corroborate.  As long as you're not doing a kind of deal that's specifically subject to special signature rules, closing this way is fine.  I have done it myself, for deals where I was a party.  I have occasionally been able to help clients do it.

This sounds in many themes.

One is the universality of writing.  There's nothing magical about any particular way people write words.  [Why can't we just put the text of our drafts of terms in e-mails, too?](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/12/09/Paste-Terms-E-Mails)

Another theme is the [hubris of "legal technology"](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2020/03/29/Against-Legal-Technology).  Why do we need apps and services specific to legal signature, like DocuSign?  What's insufficient about the general-purpose tools we have?  We didn't really need law-specific pens, [law-specific handwriting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_hand), or law-specific paper.  Do we really benefit from inhabiting a parallel technical universe of law-specific products, processes, and services?  Do clients benefit?
