<aside class="brief" markdown="1">
We've renamed a standard form NDA to make it easier to adopt.
</aside>

Today I, along with other companies and lawyers developing and using a standard nondisclosure agreement, renamed our form.

Hello, [The Waypoint NDA](https://waypointnda.com).

If your company wastes time reviewing and negotiating two-way nondisclosure agreements, The Waypoint NDA is the actually standard form you've been waiting for.  Adopt it at your company, [send us any feedback you have](mailto:comments@waypointnda.com), and [add your company to the website](https://waypointnda.com/#listing), so more will be encouraged to follow your lead.

Boring, two-way, commercial NDAs are crying out for standardization, and everybody in business law knows it.  Now, more than ever, there's something you can do about it.
