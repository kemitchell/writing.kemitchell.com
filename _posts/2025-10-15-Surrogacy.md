If you have access to [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com) and teach or think about contracts, I'd strongly recommend ["The Baby Died. Whose Fault Is It?"](https://www.wired.com/story/the-baby-died-whose-fault-is-it-surrogate-pregnancy/) by Emi Nietfeld, about a contract for [surrogacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy) gone wrong.
