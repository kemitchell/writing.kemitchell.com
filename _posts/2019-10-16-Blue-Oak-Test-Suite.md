[Blue Oak Council](https://blueoakcouncil.org) has just published a ["test suite"](https://blueoakcouncil.org/tests) for public licenses, in the form of a taxonomy of kinds of software projects, with famous open-source examples.

I anticipate the test suite will be useful _both_ for license analysis, _and_ as an educational tool.  Lawyers and other professionals without software backgrounds can use the suite to get a sense of what kinds of software are out there, and how they relate, as well as learn some important project names.
