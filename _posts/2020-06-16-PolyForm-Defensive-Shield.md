Thank to feedback, the PolyForm Defensive license, which prohibits competing with the provider of the software being licensed, has now been renamed [PolyForm Shield](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0).

Shield's sister license, [PolyForm Perimeter](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/perimeter/1.0.0), prohibits competing with the software being licensed.  Both Shield and Perimeter are fairly described as "defensive".  Now that commonality's more clear.  We can call these licenses the "defensive" licenses.

Their fundamental difference within that category is also clarified.  Perimeters are tools for defending fixed positions.  Shields are tools for defending persons.  Perimeter is the license for defending positions staked out by the projects.  Shield is the license for defending the people and companies making software available.
