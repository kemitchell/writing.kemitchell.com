I have successfully registered `WAYPOINT` as a United States trademark for "downloadable electronic publications in the nature of guides, legal forms, and business forms in the field of law".  The registered trademark add further legal protection for the integrity of the Waypoint NDA, providing users more assurance that "Waypoint" will mean just one set of standard, vetted, protected legal terms.
