Those interested in open source, funding, and online collaboration more generally should definitely add [Nadia Eghbal's _Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/) to their lists.  It's available as a rather handsome hardback, and for Kindle.

Suggested Pairing: [Thomas Streeter's _Net Effect: Romanticism, Capitalism, and the Internet_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0814741150/)
