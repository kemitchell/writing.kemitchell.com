Earlier this year, a company called Slock.it wrote, released, and
ran a computer program called The DAO.  The DAO was designed to
function like a seed-stage venture capital firm, soliciting capital,
taking investment decisions, remitting returns to investors, and
administering back-office processes.  Receive capital it did.

The DAO ran not on one computer, but on many, using a system called
Ethereum.  Ethereum permits many computers belonging to many people to
perform and verify every software instruction followed by a computer
program, like The DAO, calculating for themselves the effects on the
accounts of each participant.  Each account is protected from basic
frauds, like double spending.

As it turned out, The DAO's instructions created a loophole.
The loophole was discovered.  Ethereum users watched an anonymous
peer carry off capital from The DAO's digital accounts, all in strict
compliance with its code, independently verified by a multitude
of willing, diligent, and indifferent machines, many belonging to
those defrauded.

Troubled by the outcome, a large group of Ethereum users agreed to
introduce an otherwise invalid transaction to reverse the effect
of invoking The DAO's vulnerable code.  This initiative stood each
Ethereum user at a metaphorical fork in the road.  Either they could
join those following The DAO as it played out, by its terms, or they
could join the larger group making a specific exception, overriding
Ethereum's rules to avoid The DAO's outcome.

Every part of this process has been noisy, controversial, and
self-consciously philosophical.  The energetic Ethereum community
is not united by wonkish obsession with the back-offices of venture
capital firms or the arcana of corporate governance and securities law.
Rather, they rally behind the promise---prospect---of computer programs
that run reliably and verifiably, unbeholden to and unassailable
by human fallibility and interested-party control of computing
infrastructure.  It's a vision of governance of laws and not of men,
with the laws all in code and the men, if men there must be, tightly
confined to narrow corridors of well-understood economic incentives,
like cattle in a chute.

The more politically and philosophically oriented elements of the
community aim to break with troublesome aspects of the prevailing
order, from the boom-bust-bailout of the financial cycle to pervasive
surveillance, regulatory interventionism, and the prohibitive cost
of justice.  Casualties be damned, that Ethereum should operate
like so many meaty, judgment-dependent institutions of yore irks
them mightily.  As does the stampede of blockchain start-ups, often
VC-funded, scurrying to apply breakthrough technology to more banal
problems of banks and accounting firms handling so much money, they
can't reliably count it all.

Early English common law was infamously complex, fiendishly exact,
and coldly unfeeling.  At least in principle, it was not up to judge,
jury, or attorney to account for the evident injustice of a properly
derived legal result.  Like a great machine turning over, the courts
were meant to receive the law, tracing its authority back to the
king's, and apply it to cases as a mechanized brewery applies bottle
caps to new brewskies.  The process was not entirely mechanical---the
law came down and moved around in unstructured form, a mad babel of
Law Latin, Law French, and bastard English, often unwritten---but the
view of its proper function often was mechanical.  All in keeping
with the elemental, if exception-ridden, notion of monarch as font
of all property rights.

Those run over roughshod by the common law could appeal, as one might
appeal today for review or a pardon, for the direct intercession of
the monarch or his confidants.  The common law being what it was, such
requests mounted, and the duty of reviewing and responding to them
was similarly delegated to a specialized servant of the crown, the
Lord Chancellor.  The Lord Chancellor was meant to embody the King's
softer, conscientious, divine-representative side, with corresponding
authority over souls, as distinct from property.  The Lord Chancellor
got busy and so begat his own court, the Court of Chancery.

The Earl of Oxford's Case, decided in 1615, established the primacy of
the Chancery Court's "equitable" orders, grounded in often fuzzy and
naturalistic principles, over those of the courts of law.  In other
words, the Court of Chancery could issue orders, called injunctions,
against performance of legal orders and further suits in the courts
of law.  Equity became the flexible yin to law's rigid yang.  Hard law
made a strong case for flexible equity, which expressed its gratitude
by making equitable decisions seem squishy, arbitrary, corruption-prone
in comparison to legal ones.

The distinction between law and equity echoes in the English legal
systems and its derivatives, including America's legal systems,
of today.  Remedies---actions you can ask a court to take on your
behalf---are divided into legal remedies, like the payment of
money damages, and equitable remedies, like orders to perform your
part of a deal, transfer an interest in property, or refrain from
specific conduct, all backed up by penalties for contempt of court.
Old principles of equity, oft quipped as pithy "maxims", even in
modern court decisions, still apply to some equitable remedies.
He who comes into equity must come with clean hands.  Equity will
not allow a statute to be used as a cloak for fraud.

Both English and American legal systems have nominally collapsed law
and equity into a single system, with courts hearing arguments based
in both legal and equitable principles, and handing out remedies
of historically legal and equitable pedigrees.  A few states and
federal subject areas maintain specific equity courts, some very much
on theme, like United States bankruptcy courts, and others for more
dubious and idiosyncratic reasons, like Delaware's Court of Chancery,
which takes first pass at vitally important corporation law issues.

In the main, the trend is toward single courts that do the business of
justice without regard for the old dichotomy.  This is often far more
efficient:  It's fairly clear where you ought to bring your lawsuit,
and easier to juggle one set of rules, procedures, and schedules
once you get there.  On the other hand, it's sometimes hard to tell
whether a court is refining and applying rules for strict application
or making room for itself to avoid an unjust result.  This has been
especially clear in contract law of late, with many courts straining
to invalidate "contracts of adhesion", like dense online terms of
service, and specific provisions, like commitments to arbitration
that deny consumers access to the public courts.  Some courts have
even seemed to play games with ambiguity and vagueness, seizing on
whatever weakness they can manufacture to avoid doing The Wrong Thing.

Legal practice has a habit of deep-freezing vocabulary and ideas
well past their expiration dates.  But as often as I'm a critic of
current legal practice and style, I think there's something more to
the particular holdover of law-versus-equity.  There is something
intuitive, archetypical in the idea of salvation from a cold and
unflinching rule.  I'm not sure one mind responsible for both can do
as well as two minds, one framed to do each.

How many Russian serfs must have cried out "If only the tsar knew!" in
exasperation before 1905.  How many of us clamor now for a Snowden
pardon in the twilight of another presidential term.  How many VC funds
and other companies settle internal disputes by written compromise or
amending their governing documents.  A long time ago, we discovered
that rules and a predictable way to apply them make a powerful antidote
to individual bias and corruption.  But we've yet to build any system
on that first principle that doesn't chew through good people for bad
reasons on a regular, if tolerably infrequent, basis.  We've always
needed an escape valve, and omitted one at our moral peril.

There is a kind of technology in recognizing, accepting, and coping
with the malice and incompetence of human agents we have to trust.
To their credit, the Ethereum community has never artificially limited
its problem to its software, or even the network running its software.
Vitalik Buterin's writing has considered incentives to fork and
the likelihood of programming errors from very early on.  He was
not alone.  Optimism has definitely been a constant, but modulated
by a commendable respect for the limits of current knowledge and the
dimensions of the problems they've opted not to skirt.

To this lawyer's eye, the most interesting thread in that thinking
has always been "proof-of-work" versus "proof-of-stake" systems.

The best-known programs of Ethereum's type, including Bitcoin,
enforce rules requiring those who participate in deciding which valid
decisions count and when to solve difficult computer puzzles as a kind
of raffle ticket for temporary executive office.  These are called
"proof-of-work" rules.

The puzzles require lots of computer power, which costs lots of
money.  The more computers participate in the network, the more
pricey computing power it takes to overwhelm the odds of all the
other participants buying raffle tickets.  Proof-of-work rules aim
for the same effect---no small group of participants can take over
collective decision making---without relying directly on expensive,
often wasteful real-world challenges, like who can amass the most
specialized computers or achieve the largest economy of scale in
using them.  Facts the network wouldn't otherwise give a hoot about.

Proof-of-stake systems, by contrast, do not limit bad behavior
by tying participation to a limited real-world resource.  Instead,
proof-of-stake systems levy procedural penalties against participants
proffering transactions the network refuses to honor, in the form
of reduced credits or privileges tracked within the network itself.
Rather than requiring participants to spend real-world assets, like
computing power, to buy executive office raffle tickets, proof-of-stake
systems hand out raffle tickets, votes, or other powers to all, and
punish their ill use after the fact, by a reduction in further right
to participate.  If those involved value ongoing participation on equal
footing, therein lies their incentive to play straight.  The effect is
much like party discipline or adherence to rules of order at a meeting.

Proof-of-stake systems have proven plenty capable in many specific
applications, especially within organizations that hold other levers
of control over diverse mechanisms and incentives, and wherever the
risk of collusion among double-spending fraudsters is low, even if the
risk of malfunctioning software is real.  In the lingo, malfunctions
and attempted fraud are both "Byzantine faults"---invalid messages
that computers can't immediately recognize as bunk.  A copy of the
Ethereum program running haywire on a machine frazzled by hardware
failure is a Byzantine fault.  So is a program masquerading as Bitcoin,
but designed to convince others to confirm transactions in an order
designed to leave payees empty-handed.  So, in a manner of speaking,
are messages from Ethereum users on different tines of the Ethereum
DAO "fork".

However, to my knowledge, only proof-of-work rules have succeeded at
large scale in systems, like the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks, without
overarching checks and balances---derisively, "centralized authority".
Such use cases, in the aggregate, probably make up the vast majority
of useful applications of the underlying Bitcoin-esque technology.
But for those of a more political bent, those use cases are precisely
the uninteresting, even repugnant ones.

Lack of central authority without the wastefulness of proof-of-work
rules is the techno-political dream, in that it would make the
system wholly self-contained, a kind of sealed Bottle Garden of
Economic Eden.  Such a system might be used to make agreements or
administer organizations that interact with the real world, say by
performing services or dealing in goods.  But their software-automated
bits could be verified and audited by the network independently,
guaranteed by the shared interest of others utilizing the network in
accurate record keeping.

In theory, that shared interest might be enough.  If it works
there's no need to interlock the system with other possible sources of
corrupting leverage---financial, technological, political.  That being
the case, the decentralized system clearly obviates all need for
existing centralized, evidently corruptible analogs.  It becomes
both "disinterested" in the sense of being incapable of having a
selfish interest in the outcomes it administers, and "incorruptible"
in the sense that no outside leverage can be applied to induce such
an interest.

Buterin pointed out years ago that questions about proof-of-work and
proof-of-stake systems boil down to broader questions about how much
we value "decentralization"---freedom from overarching, "centralized"
checkers and balancers that fail in manifold, often obscure, ways.
Proof of work is expensive, but that expense may be worthwhile.
Hope for a viable alternative would spare us that valuation riddle.
What we can automate safely at low cost and negligible risk, we will
be tempted to automate.  We'd rather cut the Gordian knot than untie
it or live with it.

The prospect raises two important questions.

If we find what appears to be a suitable sword, can we trust
that it will do the job?  How can we verify that the job is done?
Every durable system of governance I know of---legal, political,
governmental---has installed within itself an escape valve, a means
of correction when established rules, predictably, fail to function
adequately in unforeseen circumstances.  Even such safeguards routinely
fail.  It's no easier to architect the perfect mechanism of reform
than it is to architect the perfect substantive rule you were after
in the first place.  This is a humility every practicing deals lawyer
learns, hard or easy.  The same can't be said for every programmer.

Equity's primacy over law.  Procedures for termination and amendment.
The institution of the "dictator"---originally limited to a specific
dictate and extraordinary circumstances.  These mechanisms help to
avoid the costs and uncertainties of rebuilding anything from an
entirely clean slate, though that is always a possibility.  As far
as blockchains go, the answer is probably that failure in these early
days is livable enough to warrant free experimentation.  If a system
fails, we'll survive, and we can learn from it.  If the line of inquiry
trails off, it won't have been the first honest fishing expedition.
Blockchain as a whole might be a fishing expedition, at least as far
as the cryptoanarchists are concerned.

The harder questions is whether, having convinced ourselves that we've
found a way to solve these governance problems in utter independence
form the world around us, we _should_ use it.

The freedom-enabling, automobile-like elan of the computer is a
late-model marketing invention.  The computer more generally made
its debut as a tool of systematic dehumanization and oppression, the
conscience-free mechanical lackey of indifferent captains of industry
and McNamara-ite technocrats grinding the Bartlebys of the world
into mincemeat.  Levy's _Hackers_ describes anti-war protests on the
floor of MIT's AI Lab, then home to a Department of Defense-funded
projects and hackers bewildered that their peers should associate
computers with the war.  These days, industry and government's taste
in sprawling systems accessed by low-margin consumers via relatively
dumb devices has produced all kinds of security and privacy issues
that are beginning to unwind the glossy-full-page-ad view of the
computer once again.  Computers are seeming less cool all the time.

There is arguably no manipulation in today's politics so terrifyingly
opaque and invasive, for those outside the cabal, as the prospect
of cryptoanarchists "engineering" their incentives, binding them to
structures obscure to anyone else, and only partially understood
by any individual cryptoanarchist.  That's the kind of unchecked
prerogative we expect, but don't approve of, from ad-men, politicians,
and financiers, who have been bad enough without the advantages of
technical acuity.  It is frightfully easy to see the benefits and
liberties unlocked by one's work, maddeningly difficult even to
remember to look for the limitations and inequities.

I support these experiments, and I support the experiment that was
The DAO.  Finding a way to make these systems self-sufficient, by
fully decentralized proof-of-stake rules or otherwise, would be a
startling achievement.  But I worry that, if progress here catches
hold of the really fundamental governance problems implicated, it
will roll right over so much of what we know about governance more
generally, some of which is truly ancient knowledge.  I worry that
it will collide with strong institutions more by frenetic, Brownian
motion than reasoned engineering, even if plenty of cryptoanarchists,
young and old, will be ready to say that _this_, finally, is the
blockchain they always wanted and expected.
