If names come to mind, please [send me an e-mail](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com).  I'll be happy to announce whatever we end up calling these things, and very grateful for the smoothing effect on countless discussions on contract streamlining and standardization.

For prior art, the closest I know of is "confirmation" for agreements under ISDA master agreements and "statements of work" under preagreed master terms or a form published by one of the parties.  We're thinking specifically of short agreements that [incorporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_by_reference) nearly all of their legal terms by reference to a neutral, published, standard form.  For example, via [permalink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink).

A few quick riffs:

- "trampoline agreement"
- "springboard agreement"
- "bounce agreement"
- "termlink agreement"
- "pointer agreement"
