I finally heard enough calls for simple templates devs can use to prohibit or allow only specific uses they describe.  I've tentatively dubbed the results "Normally Open" and "Normally Closed".

Normally Open says "Everything not prohibited is permitted."  You get to fill in what's prohibited.

Normally Closed says "Everything not permitted is prohibited."  You get to fill in what's permitted.

I'm short on time.  But those interested in more context, and how these might be useful, can look at ["Ethical Subcommons Starter Kit"](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2019/03/15/Ethical-Subcommons), published in March of 2019.

A comparison, or "diff", from Normally Open to Normally Closed follows.  A lot this language comes from the Blue Oak Model License 1.0.0, with some later readability improvements from Round Robin 1.0.0.  Hopefully the text remains easy to read and follow.

There's a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/berneout/normally-open-closed) for those into that.
