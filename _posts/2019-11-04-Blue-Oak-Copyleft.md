[Blue Oak Council](https://blueoakcouncil.org) recently published a new [short guide to copyleft](https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft), complete with [lists of copyleft licenses grouped into four functional "families"](https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft#copyleft-families), as a webpage and as machine-readable data files.

The Council has been able to update some of its own sample language, such as its [starter open source policy](https://blueoakcouncil.org/starter-policy), using the new guide as a building block.  I for one have seen and prepared countless documents that would have been improved by incorporating one or more copyleft families by reference.
