I'm told "f/8 and be there" is a popular expression among photographers.  Some say it even sums up the whole wisdom of the craft.  There's a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C6%91/8_and_be_there) I expect most everyone reading this blog will enjoy.

"TNR12 and be there" would be the equivalent for lawyers.  Especially the technophiles.

TNR is short for [Times New Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman).  Twelve-point Times New Roman was the default for Microsoft Word 97, and is still the default for much of the legal profession.

Like most preachers, I have failed to practice my own point with the consistency I would advise.  This blog post will be, in part, a reminder to myself.
