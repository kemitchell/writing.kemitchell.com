Last week, [I blogged a call to help name a common but underutilized contract format](/2020/05/07/Name-This-Contract.html).  "Springboard Agreement" has emerged the clear winner.

Most folks hear the word "springboard" about every four years, during the Olympics.  Springboards are essential equipment of the [gymnastic vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUuFww8u0rw).  It's also the official name for the "diving board" from which athletes jump in [three-meter springboard events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU5j3dgk2WE).

Metaphorically, that works great.  Reading a springboard agreement, you spring off the reference into the legal terms being incorporated.  My example from the earlier post:

> # Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement
>
> The parties agree to the terms published at <https://commonform.org/waypoint/waypoint-nda/2e>.
>

A close cousin of the springboard agreement is the certified form: an agreement that starts with a guarantee that the attached, privately proposed terms are identical to a published standard.  The [Waypoint NDA](https://waypointnda.com) is my running example.  The first page:

> # Standard Form Certificate
>
> Apart from the purpose, governing law, any forum for disputes, and any specific term that I have filled in below, I certify that the following proposed terms are exactly the same as The Waypoint NDA 2.0.0 published at https://waypointnda.com.
>
> Signature: <span class="conformedSignature">Paul Proposer</span><br>
> Name: Paul Proposer<br>
> Date: January 1, 2020<br>
> E-Mail: paul@example.com
>
> **Purpose**: discussing a potential co-marketing opportunity
>
> **Governing Law**: California
>
> **Forum for Disputes**: San Francisco, California
>
> **Term**: one year

Each of these formats works works well for different kinds of norms.  Now that we have names for both, we can talk about that much easier!
