[The Oaklandside](https://oaklandside.org), my preferred source of local Oakland news, [published a piece on the letter proposing water access programs for homeless people](https://oaklandside.org/2020/12/04/clean-drinking-water-is-elusive-for-homeless-oaklanders-some-say-theyve-found-a-solution/) that I [cosigned last week](/2020/11/27/EBMUD-for-All.html).  [Natalie Orenstein](https://oaklandside.org/author/natalie-orenstein/), whose beat is housing and homelessness, wrote the story.  My friend and fellow signatory, [Derrick Soo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCimS5XwZyrvaOv3ddNpavdw), stars.
