Earlier this year, the antitrust, commercial, and administrative law subcommittee of the judicial committee of the United States House of Representative published a [report](https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf) of their [investigation into competition in digital markets](https://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=14921), specifically focused on Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple.  On page 325 of that report, in the section on Amazon's competitive use of AWS data, the report summarizes open source in a single paragraph.  Omitting the footnotes:

> Open-source licenses allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared.  Open-source software can run on any infrastructure, local machine, server room, or on the cloud, reducing lock-in to a specific hardware vendor.  Companies based on open-source software bring in revenue by selling additional features under proprietary licenses or services.  In recent years, open-source development has been a leading model for software development, attracting significant venture capital investment.

Most open licensing wonks could quibble with every sentence.  But I think that would be to miss the value here.  Given a limited amount of space and time, this is what the committee members and their aids dug up for "open source in a nutshell".  This is how they came to understand "open source", earnestly but indifferently, interested but not invested.

Good to take a look through other eyes when we can.
